Kriobolis (also known as Kribopolis) is a port city in Albland at the confluence of the Telleford River and Sea Melette. It gets its name from sacrifices of massive numbers of rams which it's thought were conducted there thousands of years ago when it was still just a little fortified area. The city also serves as the southernmost point of the continental bottleneck created by Sea Melette (to the south) and Vat (to the north).
