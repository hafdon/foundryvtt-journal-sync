## Transcript

Jean-Luc: Doesn't know either way if Nerch is controlling the other hobgoblins wearing gold circlets.

Gluggranok and Nerch are sitting on the back of the cart eating lunch, and Udrek sits next to them. Jean-Luc contemplates his Tepplin distillery bottle of hard spirits. [Intelligence not great]. JL is pretty confident Udrek is going to be into an offer to share drink. Joan sits cross-legged, reading out of certification tomes.

Startrella: Oh, so *now* you're sharing this stuff?!

Jean-Luc [History not bad] knows there are some words not to call hobgoblins; (Jean-Luc is proficient in multiple slurs and curses as part of his thieves' cant). The worst one:

- blidge (the b word)
- 'hobgolem' is not offensive nor inoffensive; it's a neologist ("A Brianniel original")

<!-- -->

Jean-Luc goes to share a drink with his "friend" (waffleface - very familiar (tu); frinkle - (usted)): Share a drink with me waffleface.<br>

Udrek: Just. Spoke. About. Drink. Udrek Teetotals. Drink. Depressant.<br>

Jean-Luc: You're just drinking with the wrong people.<br>

Udrek: What makes. Wrong? Jean-Luc: If you're getting depressed when you're drinking alcohol, I think you're doing it wrong. (He takes a big gulf and offers it to Udrek.)<br>

Udrek: Haven't. Made. Appropriate. Friendship. Gestures.<br>

Jean-Luc: In my culture, the first appropriate gesture is to share a drink with someone.<br>

Udrek: Understandable. But. Personal. Preference. For Stimulants. … You. Have. Any?

Flick thinks about her *goodberries-on-the-vine.* (Do they negate the need for food like cocaine? Experimentation is required.) Jean-Luc maay have U.S.S. (urban-style stimulants). Paros has *Haste*? Jean-Luc has a soggy vial of fizzlecoke; Cyrowan probably dripped into it at one point.

Jean-Luc: It got a little wet, but if you want I've had worse stimulants than this fizzlecoke here.<br>

Startrella: You got some wet fizzlecoke? I know just the trick. I know how to dry that stuff out.<br>

Jean-Luc: Oof. .. Yeah, what's the trick.<br>

Startrella: I guess you just heat it up for a while. You have to make sure you don't burn the coke. You use a dry double-boiler situation.<br>

Flick: So the trick is evaporation.<br>

Startrella: Yeah! That's it! Travelling amongst the stars you learn so much physics it can be really helpful. And it expands your minds for those times your mind is primed to expand. (She wanders over).<br>

Flick: Hey, Startrella, our friend Udrek doesn't want anything to bring him down this early in the morning. Would you happen to have any powders or stimulants or "caffeinated" substances we can give him?<br>

Startrella: Like i was saying, if one of you does something real nice for me, I can take one of these starmotes and pretty much turn it into anything.<br>

Flick: Real nice? Like what?<br>

Startrella: I dunno -- nothing's coming to me off the top of the dome.<br>

Flick: Like, if we helped you across the strees, or carried your grocery bags while you were trying to open a door? That kind of thing, or were you speaking in code?<br>

Startrella: Yeah like if you dig a hole and fill it with water and place your cloak over it that might do the trick.<br>

Flick: [Insight 13: if flick can create a meditative environment or pull her into the ethereal place; something to provide a sensory deprivation environment]. (Flick walks over; )

[…]

Vengeance: It's not me, it's my sentient staff that likes to pet … not ogres, but … your wonderful pet. I apologize for my staff's behavior. (His feet begin scrapingi a hole in the ground.)<br>

Glug: Udrek isn't my pet. We grew up in the same town! This is all looking a bit fishy. (He comes over and interposes himself between Udrek and the others.) I'm not nsure what you're trying to do here. Udrek can make his own decisions. All this fudging around with his head while we're eating -- I think you should just make your way on.

Jean-Luc pretends to trip in order to attempt to knock the circlet off. [two nat 20s to touch and deceive] He does it so delicately that, as he tries to pull it off, he can feel that it's embedded in Gluggranok's head, under the skin and adherent to the skull. [Strength] The circlet comes loose from his skull under one adhesion point and Jean-Luc gets as finger under it and pulls up (and out). Glugg screams as a clump of scalp tears off and he goes completely catatonic.

Jean-Luc: I'm sorry, I tripped on this tree here. -- No, I'm not sorry, this is how I do things.<br>

Cyrowan: Master Luc, this isn't how you get the ladies. Not by being a drunk and a stumbler.<br>

Flick: Shut up, squire, nobody asked you.<br>

Cyrowan: I'm Fez's squire, how dare you talk to me that way. Lord Fez, tell him!

[Initiative]

Udrek reaches behind his back, produces a massive chipped claymore, and swings at Jean-Luc with his non-coke-fingernailed hand. Jean-Luc is hurt. Paros, pulling out some sweet aromatic oils and a fizzlecyst tongue, casts Suggestion and imposes disadvantage, "I [Udrek] don't remember putting that fire out yesterday… " Udrek fails. "Oh. Trees. At. Risk. Of Fire?" Jean-Luc feels the kettlehelmet trembling, and Flick has a distant memory of being compelled to put out the bar fires. "The fire is no joke!" Yells Flick.<br>

Nerch climbs up onto the cart and attempts to push the boxes off the cart. "Hee. Hooo. Heeww." The cart rises up into the air as if on hydraulic suspension. Three boxes fall off the back of the cart, and one cracks open. It looks like the cat bus from My Neighbor Totoro, but without a cat face. Or eyes. But it can somehow see where you are. The Cart (Carty B) reverses and attempts to slam into Flick, who jumps nimbly out of the way.<br>

Jean-Luc and Drav intuit that Nerch was an urchin, and was called Nurchin as a kid to make fun of her. It's probably why she gets along with Udrek, who's being raised as an Organiborg Hobgolem.<br>

The rear door of the cart's bed flips up to provide cover for Nerch.<br>

Cyrowan: I'm here to support you, Ms Drav, as Fez is indisposed with raging fish diarrhea.<br>

Joan: I can't concentrate with all this gosh dang noise! (and rushes 80 ft closer to the fray and goes into a rage for various reasons -- "I need to know about this protocol!")<br>

Jean-Luc gives Udrek a wide berth, comes up to Gluggranok, and rips the metal circlet off his head with a sickening tearing sound. The circlet comes off the head with chunks of hair and skin attached, almost his entire scalp, and even laminae of his skull. Udrek bellows in a rage, altho the possible fire looms larger in his mind. "Forest. Important. Friend. In Pain. Conundrum. Using algorithm. To Decide." Jean-Luc dashes for the treeline. Gluggranok remains passed out on the ground.<br>

Flick runs up a nearby tree; "A mere wagon skin is no barrier to the power of the planes" as she marks Nerch and sharpshoots at her, wounding her significantly with the shots. Startrella: What are those cool ripples you're making over there?<br>

Nerch: I tried to get them to spring for a top to this thing. Maybe I should have tried a bit harder.<br>

Flick: That five gold you saved isn't looking so great now, is it?<br>

Nerch: No, just Udrek's learning board would have covered this. He has an invisible one, but the other one's made of wood, and that would have been great. -- and she loses concentration, at which point the cart reverts to inanimation. -- Carty, no! Carty B!! I lost Carty A a while ago. Carty A's the one with the top on it. You should see Carty C, it doesn't even have wheels, it's just on runners.<br>

Flick envisions the headlines after a fireball: Carty B model recalled due to flammability.<br>

Drav expertly places a fireball over Nerch's head; Flick sees that the entire wagon catches on fire, and Nerch is engulfed in flame and dies.<br>

Flick: Poor Nerch, we hardly knew ye.<br>

Jean-Luc: I'm not entirely sure we're not the bad guys here. But … I'm o.k. with it.<br>

Flick immediately hears the sound of arrows thudding into the trees around her. Targetted by an expert archer herself this time, she is pierced by arrows.<br>

Rovlar: For Nerch! Nerch won't die unrevenged!<br>

Flick: It's AVENGED!<br>

Rovlar: "Revenged" -- it's … hobgoblin slang!?<br>

Carlos jumps onto Mule, who carries the dashing, sturdy cleric closer to the battle. Startrella, still in the trance, remains … in the trance.<br>

Vengeance: Hey, Jean-Luc, do you mind if I give that device that you're holding a whirl. I just want to see what happens if I plug in. -- Jean-Luc tosses Vengeance the circlet, and the monk takes the prongs and jams them into his "brain" .. or however it was placed in Gluggranok's head.<br>

Flick: Oh, god damnit!<br>

Vek: I'm not sure they know what they're doing here, but that could be very powerful domination magic in those things. -- Drav tends to agree with Vek here.<br>

Cyrowan: You guys really like playing around with cerebral restylings, don't you. I mean, Lord Paros has enough going on to cover for everyone. If I were under the effects of an ancient higher power, I bet you all would know about it right away, you're so clever and attuned to things.<br>

[Galen's computer freezes, so I throw to Carlos for healing.]<br>

For a minute Vengeance feels his brain get cloudy and finds thinking difficult. He briefly feels bound to protect the contents of the boxes and take them somewhere. He feels comradely feelings towards Udrek and Gluggranok and Rovlar, and a generalized compliance with a nebulous force of masters. But then it looks like it didn't adhere to his body properly; some of the metal wiring snapped, and it doesn't seem like it would work anymore. (Maybe if he'd used a fizzlecyst fixative…) "Everyone, I think I know what's going on here: mind control. I believe I've solved the case."<br>

Carlos casts Healing Word on Jean-Luc.<br>

Vengeance: Take it from me, and --<br>

Rovlar (aka Vengeance): I adopt vengeance as my name! -- What were you saying?<br>

Vengeance: If I could just say to you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's a difficult life, and I don't recommend it. If I were you I would pack it in now. -- And he casts Confusion (Qi-xotic confusion) on Rovlar. Fez continues eating some wet grass.<br>

Vek: Fez doesn't really look like he knows what he's doing anymore. You should take care of him.<br>

Cyrowan: Yes - what should I do?<br>

Vek: SHould go back and check on him I think.<br>

Udrek: Poor. Nerch. Will extinguish. This fire. Later. Other fire. Now.<br>

Paros fires a fire bolt at the branch on which Rovlar is standing, but it falls short, adding more flames to Nerch's pyre.<br>

Udrek: Nother. Fire. NOoooooo.<br>

Joan sits down next to a tree in order to be able to punch it and maintain her rage. Jean-Luc dashes into another bunch of trees.<br>

Rovlar: Vengeance will visit you too! I see you making your way across the open ground.<br>

Jean-Luc: You know you could surrender.<br>

Rovlar: Why surrender when I have the tactical advantage of being higher off the ground than you?<br>

Jean-Luc: You're outnumbered.<br>

Vengeance: Jean-Luc, take a break here, I'm going to handle things.<br>

Gluggranok remains unconscious and continues to lose blood.<br>

Flick sharpshoots Rovlar, hitting once, and -- YOu'll never get another arrow that high! (Rovlar) -- missing -- I told you! -- at which Flick disappears into the Etherial plane, the Magician Archer and sky-walks out his movement speed to between two trees. [Perception 17]. Though never having done this before, Flick acclimates rapidly, and sees the following:

1. In the distance where Aphelia and Cyrowan are, Flick sees the merging of a dark black and bright white smoke
2. Where Drav is, Flick sees very faintly and rippling, the figure of Eldar suspended inside a massive suit of crystalline-light plate armor
3. Startrella, sitting there, in her papasan, is trying a couple different ways of trying out the fizzlecoke in the ethereal plane
4. Paros looks like a buffet; heaping, steaming trays of spirit food
5. Behind Flick, reddish-gold tendrils, like smokey vines, hundreds of them emerging from the boxes on the ground, and going straight up into the sky, disappearing a hundred feet up due in part to the limited visibility of the ethereal plane. A single tendril emerges each from Udrek and Rovlar.

<div>Drav dashes closer to Gluggranok intending to stabilizer her next turn. Mule, bored, makes her way down to a freestanding cabin a few hundred feet south.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Where did that elf go? It's probably because I'm so high up and she's so far down, she gave up her tactical advantage. I'm trained in the arts of battle and strategy!</div>

<div>Vengeance: Listen, Vengeance, I feel a great deal of sympathy for you, and I understand where you're coming from.</div>

<div>Rovlar: A true warrior doesn't need sympathy.</div>

<div>Vengeance: Of course not. I only offer you understanding. And solidarity. WHen I was a child, I had a very controlling father. Perhaps you know what it's like being under control yourself by a tyrannical device or whatever it is that's controlling you. I want you to know that it's okay. When I failed my fishermans exams, my father beat me near to death, and that changed the course of my life, and I realized I didn't have to be under his control anymore. So why don't you just come down from there and we'll unhook you from that thing, and you can live your life as a free hobgoblin.</div>

<div>Rovlar: I too used to be subject to the whip. I would go out in the evenings looking for midges, those delicious little bugs, and a few times I was caught by monsters, and my parents would beat me, but I always took it as a sign that they loved me!</div>

<div>Vengeance: Oh, you love midges too?</div>

<div>Rovlar: One of my favorite delicacies.</div>

<div>Vengeance: What's your favorite kind?</div>

<div>Rovlar: I like the slarm … ones. Buttermidges. Blue-green midge, i like it for the taste, even tho people think it's a panacea.</div>

<div>Vengeance: You know if you pour some fizzlecoke onto a midge and pop it in your mouth it'll explode. And my goodness, the sensation is wonderful.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Like a pop midge? Vengeance: Midge pop.</div>

<div>Rovlar: nouns!</div>

<div>Vengeance: Well you are a very knowledgeable lady. I wish you would come down from there. I don't want to have to hurt you. You're probably an innocent person. I want to get that thing off of you, so come down.</div>

<div>Rovlar: You want to get what off of me?</div>

<div>Vengeanec: The mind-control device.</div>

<div>Rovlar: You mean the way that the desire for midges controls my mind?</div>

<div>Vengeance: It is a very powerful desire. but I'm talking about this (holds up circlet)</div>

<div>Rovlar: WHy are you holding that?</div>

<div>Vengeance: I just found it. … This is what you're wearing right now. We have some really great surgeons here. Jean-Luc has taken some classes, and he can take that out for you painlessly. VERY painlessly.</div>

<div>Rovlar: No, no. I was with you talking about the midges. I was willing to make a full spread with you. But the cap -- absolutely not!</div>

<div>Vengeance: I promise, once you come down, we'll go on a full midge hunt, fry them up, it'll be delicious.</div>

<div>Rovlar: WHy can't we do that with the cap on. In fact, you all look like you would wear these caps well. In fact, I can extoll their virtues to you at length.</div>

<div>Vengeance: Just come down and we can talk aboutthat.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Is that blood on that cap you're holding.</div>

<div>Vengeance: No, I just had it in my bag with some loose newt jelly.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Oh, a platter of Bertram's midges with newt jelly (and he begins drooling out of his nose as hobgoblins do).</div>

<div>Vengeance: quick, somebody cast a freezing smell and then we can pull him down by his saliva.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Oh, i thought you were going to eat my drool as icicle treats. I've heard those are pretty taste.</div>

<div>[Deception check for newt jelly. ] In the Ethereal Plane, Flick sees people as kind of ghostly shapes without sharp details.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Ok, so it's not blood, but I don't want to let you near my cap: this is important to me.</div>

<div>Flick and Vengeance have an ominous feeling, perhaps that they are being watched. Flick can see blue, gem-like or gravelly twinklings on the ground below her. like stones spread out through the grass. She decides to attack Rovlar from within the Ethereal Plane into the Material Plane using force damage.</div>

<div>Rovlar: I'll avenge Glug too! Even though he's pitiable and still alive.</div>

<div>Carlos heals Gluggranok, The wound in his heal closes up with just a bit of residual bruising and looks like he's sleeping.</div>

<div>Rovlar: What's going on over there, did you help him? I thought i was going to have to avenge him.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: We don't have a quarrel with you.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Then why did you kill Nerch!?</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: Well, we <em>had</em> a quarrel with Nerch.</div>

<div>Rovlar: I'm notn sure why you think a quarrel with her is different from one with me. Although, I suppose, if it was about midges -- she does really despise midges, and I could see how that could escalate into immolation.</div>

<div>Vengeance: Yeah, that was the reason, you're right.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: We're happy to end this without further bloodshed.</div>

<div>Rovlar: So you'll just make your way south. Can you dispell whatever you did to Udrek?</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: It'll wear off. He's basically going to sprint for a minute.</div>

<div>Drav: I think it's for 8 hours-- Jean-Luc: Either way it'll wear off.</div>

<div>Rovlar: WIthout Carty-B or Udrek I'm kindof defenceless here. I mean, tactically, I have an advantage, but defensively, I'm at a disadvantage.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: Like I said we're not looking to hurt you.</div>

<div>Rovlar: Ok, then … go away.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc. Can't do that. [Persuasion ?]</div>

<div>Rovlar: I'll come halfway down the tree …</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: Good first step.</div>

<div>Rovlar: In exchange, will you get Udrek to come back? Or, you know what? I'd really like to see Gluggranok conscious.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc glances over at Carlos.</div>

<div>Vengeance: What is in those boxes, anyway?</div>

<div>Rovlar: that's a great question, Vengeanec. They are supplies that we need to get to the coast. It's probably best if you leave them alone. I think that handling them will give you a tactical disadvantage. It's wise to proceed south. You know what, don't even worry about Udrek or Glugg. Why don't you head south, I'll take care of this.</div>

<div>Vengeance: If there's anything I hate it's a tactical disadvantage. I think I'll just take a quick peak to see what's inside.</div>

<div>Rovlar: I'd really suggest you not do that.</div>

<div>Carlos slaps Glugg awake, but his eyes don't focus and it looks like he's awake but he's dissociated from what's going on around him.</div>

<div>Paros (has he read something on the trauma involved in separating from the hive-mind?) walks over to examine Gluggranok.</div>

<div>Cyrowan: (in the distance) the way you're taking care of yourself, master, is really going to pot. I love grass as much as the next person but you should really give it a rest.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc is remaining aware. Gluggranok's eyes refocus, and he sees that Vengeance is holding the metal cap, and he goes to grab it out of your hands.</div>

<div>Vengeance: Woh, Gluggs, this is mine now. -- and he skips out of the way. Glugg starts moaning inarticulately. -- Oh, man, this guy is going through some serious withdrawal. Startrella, do you know of anything we can do to help him? any clinics we can send him to?</div>

<div>Startrella: This looks like … maybe he's been on too many drugs at once. Usually I say put in him a drunk tank. Wait, what's he doing now?</div>

<div>Gluggranok has started making his way back towards the boxes. He arrives at the closest box and feverishly starts pulling out all the packing material.</div>

<div>Flick latches onto Rovlar's shimmery ghostly form and fires onto her. [As an Unseen Attacker, Flick gets advantage on the attack.] By Rovlar's lights, he's blasted back like a fat man getting hit in the stomach by an invisible cannon ball. Flick hears his groans of pain through the Charlie Brown Adult wah-wah filter. Flick comes out of the EP and hits her with another arrow; Rovlar's dark purple blood begin to stain the tree.</div>

<div>Rovlar: My sweet midge blood!</div>

<div>Flick: Is this not what we're doing?</div>

<div>Vengeance: It is unfortunate that you did that. On the other hand. .. (and he eyes getting over and drinking some blood)</div>

<div>Rovlar: Vengeance, my midge-infused blood makes a delicious (syrup) / rock-candy!</div>

<div>[end of session]</div>
