# Transcript

<div>- Flick (to Startrella): have you been all around this planet of ours?</div>

<div>- Star: my experience on this plane isn’t that extensive. I’ve only recently learned how beautiful this particular world is. Most of my time is spent amongst the stars in outer space. I have seen other planets.</div>

<div>- Flick: I can sent gaps in the fabric of spacetime that sent us away; do you sense any circles or portals to our southeast?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: I haven’t yet been in that area. Unless these star motes have gotten the feel of a place, the areas are pretty murky for me. I have teleport circles back on my home worlds that I can use, but here it’s pretty foggy.</div>

<div>- [**] Flick reminds herself to listen out for anyone boasting of that kind of knowledge. The starmote dimms as she returns it to her bag of holding. Frustrated at her inability to skip all the boring walking —</div>

<div>- Star: Flick, you have to remember to stay calm in the face of frustration. It does no good to get exasperated at small obstructions (obstructlettes). And … won’t the journey itself be pleasant and enjoyable?</div>

<div>- Flick: No, and maybe.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: It’s your wise and insightful mind that can analyze these small distinctions.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Joan takes any spare moments to pore through arcane tomes and archaeological texts. Even though she was overburdened with her new certifications, it doesn’t do her any good in the real world; now she’s pursuing learning for its own sake. Flick commiserates outloud with this unspoken assertion.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Traveling west, the group skirts the north shore of Laviré Lake. They leave behind them the smaller of the Goads, Mess, and turn their eyes to a strange island in the lake: a curious orange color, it’s devoid of vegetation or built structures. It looks like it might have been blasted by a spell or hideous event. It’s entirely flat and the surface sits just barely above the water level. Nor is it clear from what source Lake Goading is fed; the Nephil Mountains watershed goes straight to Snaff Bay. Maybe it’s fed by underground streams or an aquifer.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: This place is pretty messed up, huh, guys?</div>

<div></div>

<div>They pass between Thubudder Forest and Pulldevil Grove (did devils pull people’s arms and legs out, and give them life? or was it where the devil had his tail pulled, cast into Hell until he could recover his tail?) onto a level plain, in the far distance of which they see a prominent oxbow lake, a small town, and three conspicuous mountain peaks with ominous black shapes circling the apexes. (Or, perhaps the islands behind the peaks are still living volcanous spreading ash and rocks in small belches.)</div>

<div></div>

<div>The continue along a riverbank fed by marshes which propagate at the foot of the Braided Mountains. Flick and Drav consider returning to the gnoll village to wait for the peryton to show itself in the middle of its range. Flick pulls Vek out of its bag.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: Thanks for the fresh air; it gets pretty cramped in there. You want to know what you have to do to unify the peryton and a succubus kiss? I would need to see the peryton up close, since I haven’t done exactly this; if you were able to subdue her in some way I could probably pull it off; but if she’s in a state of violence, I probably couldn’t do it against her will. Usually the people who come to me are willing ascetics. pretty weak dudes, kinda like Hiero / Vengeance over here.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: Could you do it if she were unconscious?</div>

<div>- Vek: Yeah if you put her in a earthly concavity, sprinkle some dirt on us, allow me to sneak in there.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Paros: metaphorically?</div>

<div>- Vek (to Paros): You’ve got quite a few extraneous spirits hanging around you.</div>

<div>- Paros: no … well, they aren’t extraneous.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: Oh, cool, cool, I guess I’m just not seeing the whole picture. — they weren’t born with you, and they were never properly integrated. They might be Paros-itical. I’m grasping for words here. You’re a bit of a conundrum, spiritually.</div>

<div>- Paros: is that a good kind of condundrum?</div>

<div>- Vek: Sure, I like a challenge, or a puzzle — sure, it’s a neutral term. — Great, so Flick, you’ll just carry me in your arms from here on out, let me get some air.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: I could stick you on Mule, in one of the panniers.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: Aw, sounds great, Mules are very close to the earth.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc and Paros appear skeptical at Vek’s very nature.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: I can try really … really hard to make this jar look like a face. (Beetle exoskeletons slide into place as eyes and a dead earthworm makes its mouth.) —I’m not hearing many compliments. All these creatures are dead, so … you should be pretty confident in me. (The creatures begin to slide to the bottom of the jar.)</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick produces some fizzlecyst poison distillate to hand to Jean-Luc. Vengeance sees Flick passing something to Jean-Luc, probably a very high percentage alcohol beverage.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vengeance: I hate to interrupt, but I think it would be best if I took that. I’m actually quite parched and could use a drink. If you don’t mind (and he goes to yoink it).</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc bobbles the drink in going to protect it, and as it hot-potatoes among the three of them, Flick gets a firm hold on it. Flick backs up twenty feet —You really don’t want this in your mouth! - Vengeance: Look, we’re having fun here, playing fizzlesack, there’s no need to drink it. Jean-Luc offers Vengeance a slug from the silver star bottle.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Star comes over: Hey, y’all aren’t bogarting one of those drinks, are you? Maybe we should all get used to sharing and passing stuff around, you know?&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc, still distrustful of the blue being, has no idea what Startrella is referring to, nor what her intentions are.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Star: No response? You get so weird off this stuff. Fine, whatever. It’s not my place.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: Excuse me for not trusting someone who’s incorporeal and spirit controlling one of our friends.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: I’m totally corporeal, look at this! (She begins fizzlesacking).&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Vengeance starts fizzlesacking too —Yeah, Jean-Luc, look at this! You don’t need to drink to have fun. Flick waits for an opportune moment …</div>

<div>- Star: Vengeance, check this out, go long!</div>

<div>… to give Jean-Luc the poison vial. Vengeance monkishly hyperextends his arms in an attempt to go long. —No, your feet! says Star. Use your feet!</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Oh, no, my feet are way too blistered.</div>

<div>- Star: Well it’s a lot like … you can use any part of your body but your hands.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: well my hands are the only part of my body that doesn’t hurt right now. I guess I’ll go back over to Jean-Luc.</div>

<div>- Star: Ok, that’s a little less cool, but sure.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Mule goes over and nuzzles at Drav, who pets her back.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Oh, she doesn’t usually like dwarves! You see, the sorceress who turned her into a mule happens to be a dwarf herself.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Drav: Really? Who was it?</div>

<div>- Vengeance: I’m a little fuzzy on the details myself. She’s a dwarf. I was going to ask, since you have that book, which is written in dwarvish, is that correct? - I happen to be looking for a dwarf book, that tells of the creation of secret portals to the far realms. If you could keep a lookout, i’d be most appreciative.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Drav: Suuuuuuure.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: You two are talking about portals over here? It’s a lot of portal talk for one day? Don’t you ever just want to plant, enjoy what’s around you. — The silent treatment? you guys on a bunch of grass?</div>

<div>- Vek: No, they don’t have grass, otherwise I’d ask them to plant it in me. And see about turning Hiero into that oak.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: should we get going? I hate to be the most motivated one, but … it’s getting a bit stale.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav considers a short rest; Flick suggests tending to Graal in some way so she can travel on her own. Fez comes over first; those who he passes expect to feel the warm, comforting, stimulating aura, but instead they catch the smell of dead fish and brine. Fez reaches out with one of his salves, rubs it on Graal’s skin, but instead of healing her, the skin becomes black and rubbery. —It must be some kind of interaction with the necromancy? Maybe the oil went bad. Carlos comes over and meditates for a moment, reaches out and touches Graal; the rubbery flesh sloughs off, and there is healthy tissue underneath, which Carlos causes to heal over [remove curse + healing word] , but without restoration of the two missing limbs (on the right-hand side).&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: Sorry about that, Graal. You’re very big.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Graal: I wouldn’t have made it through the portal if I didn’t lose those two arms. I’m pretty sure I can get these two arms back. We don’t have four for nothing.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: Are you going to be ok out here?</div>

<div>- Graal: Just heading back home, now. Are there any places that would welcome a slowly healing ape guardian.</div>

<div>- Flick: Well there’s Seomra Crann, but don’t tell them we sent you.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Graal: Heh. That’s a common sentiment among the Girallon. It’s considered polite not to mention who else you know as a shared friend.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: If they ask about a a sheriff and maritime law, just tell them the sentence has been carried out.</div>

<div>- Graal: — Sure… i should be able to remember. But the road is safe?</div>

<div>- Flick: Well it’s mostly druids, so they should be able to help</div>

<div>- Graal: Yeah, druids are pretty great. I like it when they sew flowers into your hair.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: What’s that? Flowers in your hair? That sounds too good to be true.</div>

<div>- Graal: Yeah, they’ll put them anywhere … you have hair. which it looks like you don’t have any of.</div>

<div>- Star: Yeah, I like to keep it smooth; it’s better for swimming and surfing.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: It’s even more fun when they sew the flowers directly into your skin. so you’re in luck my friend.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: Bro, first with the hand-saking, and the flowers sewn into your skin: are you in a body-mod cult or something like that?</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Yeah, it’s called the Mod Sqod, I think you’d like it— you seem like a chill character.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: Totally right!</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Dope.</div>

<div>- Star: you have some dope on you?</div>

<div></div>

<div>Vengeance gives Star some dothlarshian po’otay.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Unfortunately it has to be injected directly into your eyeballs.</div>

<div>- Star: huh, well i bet i can find a way around it with my starmotes. but … yeah, thanks. here’s this.</div>

<div></div>

<div>A starmote travels out to Vengeance. It crystallizes into a large opal (worth about 50gp). —You’re just full of surprises, aren’t you? — Yeah, hey, take care of yourself. You gotta be careful with that bodymod stuff; sometimes you don’t recover; or it can be like you’re living out a traumatic past, that someone hung you up on hooks and tortured you. maybe find someone to talk to, or a chill crew.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: You remind me of some of my childhood. … and, hey — can you make more of these jewels?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: It takes something out of me each time. Tomorrow, sure, I could make another. Also, it’s a lot easier if someone’s just done me a solid. It worries me a little that you’re bringing this up, since, in the past, my people have been milked for the ability to create jewels and jems out of their own bodies, so maybe don’t bruit this about.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: like … they’ve been killed with kindness?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: let’s say, turned into living resources to extract money from.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: don’t worry, i would never</div>

<div>- Star: Yeah, no, I could tell, but I couldn’t help but think of it.</div>

<div>- Flick: This has happened to you?</div>

<div>- Star: Not to me, no, and on this plane, but not on this planet. they made some kind of special astral plane prison or soul cage. this dragon over here probably knows about it, it’s been written about in the history books. oh and probably these two, too. Drav and Parlos? they seem bookish.</div>

<div>- Flick: so there might be something written about it?</div>

<div>- Star: well it happened on this plane, so i don’t see why not; but it’s possible some kind never got a chance to be written about. history is written by the winners. it’s heavy stuff.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: who did this?</div>

<div>- Star: well, there’s a group called the githyanki, and some are chill, and some tour around in battleships to look for loot and treasure. people think it was either them, or they were part of this slaving trade route, that they would provide people to those who wanted them.</div>

<div>- Flick: did this happen to you? or are you relaying a oral history?</div>

<div>- Star: no, i … read about it. but i remember the stuff you need to remember, like where’s the best po’otay, and who’s the chillest gang, and how to depillate yourself</div>

<div>- Flick: were any of those people Fiends or creatures from the lower planes?</div>

<div>- Star: you don’t mean like Macky “The Fiend” Matrakalis? that guy could run a town red. if you got on his train, man, you weren’t comin’ home for a week. He was something.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: tell me about it, man.</div>

<div>- Star: You knew Macky?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: well, we kind of rolled in the same circles. for a little while. we weren’t close friends or anything. but i know the legends.</div>

<div>- Star: now that I think about it, that makes a lot of sense. he was totally into getting inked up and all sorts of shit. if you’re into body mod, it’s totally possible you ran into each other.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: he did some stuff that even I shudder to think about.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: even you? you’ve told me some things just today that made me wretch a bit, but in a good way,&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: is there any other way?</div>

<div>- Star: ahaha, but yeah, there are bad ways. i start spewing out black holes and neutron stars; you have to stay out of the way; if i’m with people like yourself, you have to stay out of the way. plus i’m unconscious at the time.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: i’d really like to see that</div>

<div>- Star: you’re asking a lot of me right there, — i can’t make opals for a month after one of those. i’m just shitting out fiery nebulae for the next couple weeks.</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: how did we get here?</div>

<div>- Star: you were passing around some sweet liquids, and I wasn’t invited to partake.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick tries to get Aphelia’s attention and asks if she feels anything when she looks at the black shapes moving around the peaks.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Aphelia: they look like … remind me of the simurgh, you know, the bird on top of Seomra. the way it moves, it’s fluid. i’m not an ornithologist, and actually, my eyesite is poor, i’m sort of a close-seer from playing instruments, but i can’t _feel_ anything at this distance.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: bear in mind, i’m in way over my head here. I was mostly wondering if there is any affinity between you and calliope that would resonate over long distances.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Aphelia: well if there’s any way to create a low-frequency resonance over that distance.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: you said some beasts can do it; … could a bear? — I’m reasonably certain that the cauldron from Shoemaker will let me turn into a bear. it does seem like i’d have to recharge it after use, but I offer that as a solution.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Aphelia: can i see the helmet?</div>

<div>Jean-Luc [insight on aphelia/star: thnks Star could be modifying her message a bit?]. —Promise to give it back! Aphelia brings the helmet over to Graal, who touches it, at which point it increases to Graal’s head’s size, and Aphelia blows over the opening. Soon the sound drops so lo frequency and it can’t be heard. Flick disappears into the tree-line and readies her bow. After a few minutes, Aphelia perks up, brings the helmet back to Jean-Luc.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Aphelia: I was able to create that sound; and yes, the peryton is there, and so are, i believe, her young .I got a very evil feeling from small, unformed creatures surrounding her.</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: That’s how we do. So you know where the peryton is.</div>

<div>- Aphelia: yes, she’s on top of the tallest peak, facing us. —and gives Jean-Luc a kiss on the cheek.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez is out in the woods; Cyrowan comes over —Boy you got a kiss from a girl, how exciting!&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: yeah, not everyone can be as irresistible as I am.</div>

<div>- Cyrowan: boy oh boy you certainly are a good looking handsome oman, and a voice that hardly ever cracks.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: Just eat your vegetables and eight hours of sleep each night, you’ll get there.</div>

<div>- Cyrowan: is that it?</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: well, and study … and listen to Fez.</div>

<div>- Cyrowan: sure thing; i know we’ve been on rations here but maybe Flick’d find me some herbs? (oh man, a kiss on a cheek, what a day, i’ll never forget that one.)</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick recaps the “seven layer grift” employed to get Aphelia out of Seomra Crann. (Jean-Luc, as sheriff, declared that Flick stole a brewery’s IP-A).</div>

<div></div>

## the next morning (LONG REST)

<div>Fez looks awful. —I kept trying to sleep but I had nightmares that I was trapped in a sea tempest, and then I would drown, and wake up, and the cycle would recur. It felt like I was being pulled under the water by something I couldn’t see or feel. Drav inspects the halfling and comes to the conclusion that he’s “exhausted” by 1 level and did not receive the benefits of a long rest.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: when did you start feeling this way?</div>

<div>- Fez: I feel great all the time! (but he’s been weary since emerging from underground)</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick recalls that Fez had a converzation with Abzu, a kraken, who had said that Fez made a contract with it to survive, when some of Vek’s soil spilled into the conch. Fez said he didn’t want any part of that. Since that, his efforts at healing have been largely unsuccessful. Flick tells everyone that a lot of calimari is pig anus. Or an elder beaver god named vanilla. The team realizes they can’t do anything to help Fez out in the long term.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Waking up, Jean-Luc can hear the noise of a wagon from about 1/4 mile away, accompanied by a few creatures, heading towards them from the north. It’s not clear where they’ve come from, other than “north” - perhaps the braided mountains or thereabouts?</div>

<div></div>

<div>(For most of their time on the road they were headed west-east. two humanoid creatures walking along a cart. The cart/wagon looks like the ones they saw in the Forests of Horth, and it’s being pulled by a very large humanoid. ) Flick suggests continuing on without intercepting the caravan, and Jean-Luc expresses agreement. True to her analytical exhaustion, though, Flick describes the attack of a similar caravan group when they were transported to Horth.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: If anything it means they’re in trouble, and we should continue on our way</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: they’re probably just highwaymen, and we should avoid them</div>

<div>- Paros: We should go meet them!</div>

<div>- Drav: I’m all for continuing to head south. Altho …&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: I’m thinking of trying to sell them Startrella, who’s somewhat of a golden goose.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: “golden goose,” yeah, that’s exactly what I was trying to think of the other day.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>They determine that Startrella is a (non)binary star system, so mas changing gender pronouns. Flick suspects they might be able to find a book about it later.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: any guy strong enough to pull a full wagon is someone we don’t want to tangle with.</div>

<div>- Paros: I’m sure at least Joan could pull a wagon. Not that she would want to.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>They see that it’s a wagon which is meant to be pulled by a creature; it looks almost more like a wheelbarrow.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-luc: maybe they attacked some merchants, but how do I know that the merchants didn’t deserve it.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Jeanluc we’re about to undertake a perilous adventure. Do you think we should trade and get supplies, or kill them and get experience points. (the offbeat meritocratic ranking system that prevailed at the monastery). we haven’t upgraded our weapons in a while. who knows what foes may await us in these mountains.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: I see no harm in stopping to stop to them.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick, flabberghasted at Vengeance’s uncharacteristic reasonableness, decides also to talk to them.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>The approaching group is traveling at a walking pace, and their arrival estimated at five minutes. Flick, seeing Fez in such a bad way, thinks about the weird incel Cyrowan (incyrowan), and commits to watching closely the drippy human whenever he’s within 20 feet of fez. Paros wonders aloud at this, and Flick declares that something is off about him, and that he came from underground, which is enough to be skeptical of him. Paros doesn’t remember anything interesting from the Xanthuc temples because he was tied to a sled being pulled by Mule.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Vengeance remembers that he’d carved the name of the dwarven sorcererr Amabelle into his skin. (and her stylishness)</div>

<div>- Star: did you say amabelle? well she used to run with the fiend; she was a tatoo artist and she did his first tats, and they started running together. she’s a real legend in the biz; her tattoos could do pretty much anything. stuff as far as healing people, or giving them really big appetites, just a huge puff of some sweeet grass; she could eliminate a hangover if she wanted.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: I can’t believe how small a world this is. she was basically under my nose this whole time, if she knew the Fiend. if i could find the Fiend I could get to her. but it’s a shame that he’s dead.</div>

<div>- Star; it is too bad. it’s too bad he couldn’t live up to his namesake and live forever in the underworld, but we all have to embrace the cycle of life.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: he really went out with a bang, being thrown into that volcano.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Star: yeah some people say that everytime you breathe in a little bit of ash, from your stogie, that you’re breathing in the Fiend. and i love that view, that he’s impeding my breathing a little bit and could one day cause my death through the growth of cancerous flesh. it’s a really great thing to look at things. and what you say about the world being small, this planet for sure is really small. i got a look at the world’s blue book, and there’s only, say, maybe 500 to 600 of them , but other worlds, they have millions. i mean, like, entities.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Paros has no idea who Startrella is somehow. Star passes off redescribing himself to Paros.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Cyrowan: i really liked graal; can you imagine how many swords she could wield at once.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>The caravan comes into view. They appear to be hobgoblins, and the one is clearly very very large but still hobgoblin in shape if not size.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vengeance: i’m not sure i want to give them startrella anymore; we’ve kind of bonded. i’m not sure what i’ve gotten us into.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: how about we all come out of the trees so they don’t think we’re trying to ambush them.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc stands in the middle of the road with a friendly wave. The huge hobgoblin looks like it’s been carved from wood, and has terrifying white eyes (a hobgolem if you will, says Flick, bragging of her intelligence) . the one on the west shouts out “and who be there!”</div>

<div>- flick : travellers looking merely to trade news of the road.</div>

<div>- Glug: which way are you going?</div>

<div>- flick: towards the mountains.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Glug: and what pace might you be keeping? should we go ahead or stay behind?</div>

<div>- Flick : as fast as we can</div>

<div>- Glug: our pace is limited here by Udrek. (grunts)</div>

<div>- Flick: your companion is … i’ve never seen anything like him. what is he and how did you find each other</div>

<div>- Glug: yes, hes almost one of a kind. we grew up in the same town; you’d consider it a town; for hobgoblins it’s almost a city.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: i kind of wanted to know, is why is he so huge</div>

<div>- Glug: it turns out if you don’t limit the growth of certain hobgoblins they can grow illimitably large. he’s only six months old</div>

<div>- Paros: oh so he’s like a Gold Fish</div>

<div>- Glug: he’s certainly worth his weight in gold, and has the eyes of a dead fish, but those qualities belie a quite active mind.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick : Udrek, how does this day find you, if I mind you.</div>

<div>- Udrek: Day. Today. Warm. Arms Strong. // Ever thought. How. Universe. Infinite?</div>

<div>- Star: yeah man, the universe is so big it’s hard to get your mind around. this Udrek, he’s definitely got smarts.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Udrek: Agree. With. Blue. Lady.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>&lt;&lt;The gang pauses.&gt;&gt;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: what do you have in your wagon, guys. When we saw you on the road we thought we could trade with you.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Glug: mostly we do wholesale; we’re bringing some goods down to the coast. we get money from the owners of the ships, and they take our goods and try to make a profit. It’s really just “fine” commodities.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: so you’re middlemen?</div>

<div>- Glug: you could call us that&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Paros: what sort of commodities do you trade in?</div>

<div>- Glug: high-value metals and gems; as to middlemen — we do most of the sourcing ourselves; we find these things on ancient or more recent battlefields.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: you’re scavengers!</div>

<div>- Glug: that’s a bit of a slur, but i think not entirely inaccurate.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick (remembers) growing up around cressida, it lies … just north of the town where i grew up, the border had been fought over by smaller kingdoms constantly in centuries past, and there was a lot of this kind of unsavory trade. as individuals, turning up whole pieces of metal from ages past, they were alright, but it left a bad taste in my mouth).</div>

<div>- Paros: can we take a look at some of the stuff you’re trading?</div>

<div>- Glug: it’s a kind offer, but we do have contractual obligation to meet weight requirements witih the wholesalers. we were right at the limit when we got all this stuff together. anything less and we’d have to renegotiate.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Paros: if there’s something of value and little weight …&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Glug: we’re a bit vulnerable to an assault, but we like to keep a low profile. you looked trustworthy enough.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Paros: it may be to your advantage.</div>

<div>- Glug: typically, disagreements this sophistical we leave to Udrek to sort out in his massive woody mind, a nice “pithy’ answer as to whether or not it would be worth. but we’ll just proceed to the coast if it’s all the same to you.</div>

<div></div>

<div>(Flick wonders how battlefield scavengers are finding gems, but can’t quite get a read on Glug. However, Paros’s knowledge of history, knows that a lot of hobgoblins claim resources that are other peoples; either throught military might or subterfuge; these could be ill-gotten gains, but not all hobgoblins operate that way. they might not be “old” battlefield finds; but they could scavenge from recent battlefields, or other hobgoblins, or they could be highwaymen.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>(Can Paros’s eye see residual emotions left on the items of previous owners. — he would have to be able to see the object. Instead, he casts “detect thoughts”)</div>

<div>[- maybe i’ll let him cast detect thoughts from the eye; like it gives him an extra slot for certain spells]</div>

<div></div>

<div>Able to step behind a rock, Paros surreptitiously screams and clutches his brain, beseiged by an infinitude of inner spirits, disguising the fact that he’s casting a fairly commonplace spell. &lt;&lt;&lt;Udrek is engaged in hypercomplex mathematical equations about economy. Glugranok is getting a little impatient but still seems confident and self-assured. &gt;&gt;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc can see that there is bast or stuffing coming out of the crates; given how heavy on the wheels it’s lying, and how hard Udrek is pulling, can gather that there is a lot of metals or minerals. it’s probably not raw materials, or they’d be doing it in larger quantities. they are probably “goods”, not bricks of ore. Paros tries to press deeper with Detect Thoughts on Glugranok, who surprisingly pushes the probing psyche out of his mind, ending the spell. Paros is able to tell that something else is aiding the spell’s defeat, not just the hobgoblin’s innate wisdom.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Glug: ok, well if you’re moving swiftly — we don’t want to encounter each other again — we’ll just post up here and wait for you to move on?</div>

<div>- Paros: you’ll never meet anyone who’s as comfortable with awkward as am i</div>

<div>- Flick: Udrek, um, what’s in the cart.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Udrek: Finished. Goods.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc (to party): well if these fine gentlemen don’t want to sell their wares, perhaps we should be on our way.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: Udrek, why did you leave the rest of them behind?</div>

<div>- Udrek: Friends. With. Me. Here.</div>

<div>- Flick: I saw the rest of your caravan.</div>

<div>- Udrek: What? Just this cart I pull.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: ok, Glug, quite far to the north of here i saw the remains of a caravan i’d be very surprised to find you’re not a part of. who wanted this stuff so badly they were willing to kill for it?</div>

<div>- Glug: we came straight from the Braided Mountains. How much further north was it?&nbsp;</div>

<div>(He’s telling the truth from coming from the Braided Mountains. But why are they pulling the same kind of cart? And _what_ had been pulling Ox’s cart?)</div>

<div>- Paros: It must have sucked to pull the cart for such a long time.</div>

<div>- Udrek: Like. Diversion. From. Brain.</div>

<div>- Paros: have you tried whiskey?</div>

<div>- Udrek: Whiskey. Depressant. Need. Body. Simulated.</div>

<div>- Vek: heh Flick what’s this guy talking about. i heard something about a body. stimulus.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick runs over and grabs Vek off Mule, holding him on her hip like a laundry basket. ``—There’s something seriously strange about the guy with the cart. Can you tell anything about whether his consciousness is supposed to be in his body?``</div>

<div>- Vek: you’re gonna have to get me a bit closer. From here he looks like he’s properly … woven … his body is massive and treelike (again, Vengeance might want to get in on this), but looks like a perfectly normal creature. But like his eyes look a lot like the face i was making for you guys, with the dead beetles — remember? — i feel like i was basing it off a pretty handsome template. look at this hobgoblin: “that’s a big handsome hobgoblin!”</div>

<div></div>

<div>[History from Drav 20 and Flick 18]. Drav, would know that there have been skirmishes between Longbeard, Broadbeam, and Greyknuckle clans. however, the areas under those clans, and up northwest, they are rumored to have hobgoblins; what’s strange is that the hobgoblins almost never work with humans from Cressida, but the guy Ox you saw yesterday was human. It would be strange for them to be working together, but at the same time hobgoblins do have access to both sides of the mountain because their tunnels run. and they are using old dwarf tunnels that the dwarves left or been forced out of.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc believes that, even if they’re scavengers carrying out a contract, that’s just the world we live in.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: we’re going to head south, and we won’t take up anymore of your time.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Glug: oh, no, I’m sure Udrek wouldn’t mind a break. (they grab some provisions from the cart and start eating them — mostly jerky, biscuits, light ale, which Udrek eschews. The hobgolem almost seems to root himself securely in the soil. )</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick examines the large creature again: was he pleading with them? is he under duress? Flick doesn’t detect that Udrek is resistant to manual labor. Drav, acquainted with minerals, detects a glint of metal from the hairline of Udrek and Glugranok. Neither is wearing a helmet; but they do both have long hair. Remembering the advanced roboticism of dot-dot, they wonder if the “hobgoblins” are actually cyborg for a brief moment. “Organiborgs!” Paros shouts out.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Paros uses his third eye; [charisma check with advantage (DC 17)] there is some kind of mind control going on, the two guys in the front. The lady in the back is now hiding behind the cart. He does a crazy dance in the field attempting to disguise a sequence of message cantrips cast in tandem informing the party. Vengeance gets a little jealous.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vengeance: hey could you teach me some of those moves?</div>

<div>- Cyrowan: Yeah Paros, I haven’t seen Fez do anything like that. you look like a dance master.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Paros (reluctantly): yyyy…eah</div>

<div>- Udrek: What. Dancing. Business!</div>

<div>- Glugranok: Is this how you all get started on a journey?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: what ho, friend! your companions have introduced themselves. we haven’t had the pleasure.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Nerch (hiding behind the wagon): Meeeeeee? awhy are you laughing??&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: come on out</div>

<div>- Nerch: I have very delicate skin.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav tries unsuccessfully to sneak up parallel with Nerch.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Glug: your dwarven friend here seems to be lost. I thought we’d agreed you’d head south.</div>

<div>- Drav: Just admiring the stones here.</div>

<div>- Glug: Oh, I can tell you quite a lot. I’ve devoted a great majority of my life to studying the stones in the braided mountains.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav can’t get a good sightline on Nerch with all the trees in the way. —What about the stones?</div>

<div>- Glug: we’ve taken over some of the old tunnels that were abandoned in the day, and so I like to fancy myself a dilettante, we could expand the tunnels; hobgoblins need a bit more vertical space underground than dwarves. i’ve learned quite a bit about gems and metals. it also helps my work when we go around the battlefields extracting those things left behind.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Paros hypothesizes that perhaps these mind control effects are why Detect Thoughts didn’t work. He and Drav can’t figure out why the metal is so familiar to them. The color, though, is a reddish-gold. not like Paros’s bracer. Flick by now has been alerted to the circlets; she approaches closer, around the wagon, to try to engage Nerch — she finds her shyness highly suspicious.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: you said your skin is really delicate. this wagon isn’t covered: it’s not keeping you out of the sun.</div>

<div>- Nerch: you can see that the sun is coming from the south-west; if i take cover here under the corner it won’t affect me as much. And you can feel this terrible wind passing, can’t you? it’s much nicer to be on the leeward side of Udrek here.</div>

<div>- Udrek: Leeward. Cover. For. Nerch. Pleasure.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Nerch is wearing a robe over light leather armor and carrying a staff.&nbsp;</div>
