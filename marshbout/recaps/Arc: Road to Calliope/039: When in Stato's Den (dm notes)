# When in Stato's Den
# the real peryton is definitely friendship

- animated table made by dwarves, and the screamer, definiteyl mean it used to be owned by dwarves, and palchin is definitely an impostor of a kind
__lorelei__
Oozasis
**LIkho** to annoy them and also red herring as the organ-eating ones
- maybe Palchin is a redcap "human"
__Jean-luc__ Reconfiguring Curse. The mirror hag curses a living creature within 60 feet, giving it beastly or hideous features. The target of the reconfiguring curse must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Charisma damage. A successful save renders the target immune to further uses of that hag's curse for 24 hours. (mirror hag)
  - item (some kind of mirror?)

## homebrew
__hagatusjōn__, __strigge__, __strix__, __larua__
- The form hegge is found once early in 13th cent.; hagge once in 14th; otherwise the word is not known till the 16th cent. Usually conjectured to be a shortened form of Old English hægtesse, hæhtisse, hægtes, -tis, hegtes ‘fury, witch, hag’ = Old High German hagazissa, hagazussa, hagzus, Middle High German hęcse, German hexe, Old Low German *hagatussa, Middle Dutch haghetisse, Dutch hecse ( < Old Germanic *hagatusjōn-).
- something like "what you think to be a hag is one small facet of what they once were; what they indeed are and have the possibility to become again; a power like unto the dragons or the giants or the devils" 
"hags" as another (playable?) race: An elder race—much older than the elves, and as old as the dragons, they claim—red hags are the most cunning and longest-lived of the hags, having a lifespan of more than a thousand years.
- [i like this as modality for all hags] Rumored to be the oldest hag and progenitor of all other hags in Exandria, the Hag Mother arrived in the world just after the Founding. She has a soft spot for humanoids in peril that caused her original coven to exile and bind her to Exandria with a magical curse. She wanders the land, making deals with people in dire straits, offering the power to save themselves in return for their service. The tasks the Hag Mother asks of those who accept her deals are always dangerous and sometimes grotesque and cruel. Some of these quests save lives, while others end them. Others still result in the creation of more hags. Many of the missions seem to serve no purpose, but the Hag Mother always has a plan. Whether her endgame is to destroy her enemies, break her curse, or rule Exandria is known only to the Hag Mother herself.
- why do "hags" supposed to look like they do?

## mysteries

### angatra (malagaysy mystery)

### flutterflesh (ToB)
- One can always tell where a flutterflesh resides because so many of the locals are missing appendages.

## preparing for what-if-we-die-to
- Soul Eater (ToB)
- Psoglav Demon (ToB) - steals your shadow and turns it against you; also: What's under that helmet??

## deathwisp (tob) draining people's life like scoops the rabbit or whatever

## rotting wind
- withered crops caused by this ?
- Withering Crops. Rotting winds sometimes drifts mindlessly across a moor or desert, blighting all life they find and leaving only famine and death in its wake. This is especially dangerous when they drift across fields full of crops; they can destroy an entire harvest in minutes.
- Air of Tombs. A rotting wind is an undead creature made up of the foul air and grave dust sloughed off by innumerable undead creatures within lost tombs and grand necropoli.

## ice maiden
Killing Dilemma. An ice maiden's hunger for affection and human contact leads them to harm those they approach, which only drives them harder to seek for warmth, love, and approval. Some claim an ice maiden can become a swan maiden or a dryad if she keeps a lover's heart warm for a full year.

## fate eater
- very interesting

## nightgarm
- the "falseman" created

## intrigue
__advisor not to trust__: __GILDED DEVIL__
  - also: if they've give you a gift you get negatives when attacking them; would have to suss that out.
__CHORT DEVIL__
  - _Smear Tactics_. A zealous opponent of the chort often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin's sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it.

## diseases
- White Ape (Arcane Wasting)
- 
---

## startrella
Starmotes start evolving into Sparks (ToB) which dominate person
- rides a star drake (or one of the nyx creature)

- __Risen Reaver__ (ToB)

## kraken/ fez
- Deep one archimandrite

## black earth blood / geomancy
- Degenerate Titan __HOARDS__
  - nerate titans are prone to insanity and unexpected mood shifts. They are fiercely territorial creatures who worship the still-active magical devices of their cities and any surviving statuary as if they were gods. Their lairs are filled with items scavenged from the city. These collections are a hodgepodge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.
 + Black Sun Orc / Black Sun Priestess
- __HERALD OF BLOOD__

## paros/joan (Dragons)
Dragonleaf Tree (ToB)

Emerald Order Cult Leader (ToB): reaction damage and surprise "round" stuff

## flick
- give flick something like Magic Circle (PHB) for her favored type of enemy

## creatures with weaknesses
- Kishi Demon (hyena/male faces demon): Trophy Shield. If the kishi demon killed an opponent this turn, as a bonus action, it takes part of the slain creature's essence along with a grisly trophy and mounts it upon its shield. For 24 hours, the Armor Class of the kishi demon becomes 20, and creatures of the same race as the slain creature have disadvantage on attack rolls against the kishi demon. 
  - obviously change the fact that it only goes after women 

## fight between drav and flick
- Enemies of the Ramag. The liosalfar have a longstanding rivalry with the portal-making ramag, whom they despise as "corruptors of the patterns."

## drav
###  inner planes:
- Liosalfar, and being made of light, "explorers and meddlers, a gift for patterns"
### dwarves
- dwarven ring mage (tob)
- Scheznyki: fey masquerading as dwarves.

- what is palchin wearing when they see him
- give them more gold (Jean-Luc wouldn't take what was in the other cash register)
- always remember to check in with each party member once per cycle (out of combat)

## top of mountain
- Mallqui (dry-making mummies; neutral judges of peoples )


## Goblinsmite peak

Maybe base it on this: Tofana di Rozes, Italy, 3,225m
The Dolomites’ Tofana di Rozes offers a great mountain hiking experience, gaining 1,200m from the trailhead to the summit, and adds in a component of exposed rock climbing—on novice-friendly via ferrata, providing all the experience of rock climbing without needing the expertise and knowledge of how to use rock climbing safety equipment. The Ferrata Lipella is one of the longest, but not most difficult via ferrata in Italy, a system of iron ladders, rungs, and cables that the climber is tethered into in case of a fall. The entire climb usually takes five hours, four hours of which are spent on via ferrata.
doesn't require an alpine start (two or three in the morning)

## Goblinsmite peak and goblins and story:
- Qwyllion (ToB) Goblin Mercenaries. Qwyllion and their dominated thralls and enslaved specters are sometimes engaged by goblin sorcerers and evil mages to guard desecrated temples and despoiled gardens. The terms and payments for these arrangements vary wildly from one qwyllion to the next. Anyone who dares to employ a qwyllion must be constantly vigilant, because these creatures are prone to renege on any agreement eventually.
  - Twisted Nymphs. Qwyllion (the name means "polluter" in Old Elvish) are nymphs who have been twisted by the corrupted mana of magical wastelands or warped alchemical experiments into baleful versions of their former selves.


## metal
- rust drake (ToB): feed on rusty metal
- nibbles at rust flakes on a Feyward Tree ? 
  - The tree unswervingly obeys the commands of its creators, guarding key points of entry across fey rivers and streams, abandoned sacred groves deep in the forest, suspected faerie rings, or possible elf encampments.

i didn't explain _why_ flick went mad. i guess that works for the others, since they wouldn't have known. 
- i should have given jean-luc an intimidation chance
- i should have stepped in and said what was visible on drav's face (?)
