# 038. Fall-down-fight-onomics

Printing Presses: definitely printing presses, but no gunpowder. The printing presses are just for making packing newspapers with lorem ipsum text on them. 

Gluggranok is still trying to get into one of the crates. Drav [Investigates 13] the crates as Glugg tries to interpose his body in between. Drav [Athletics 26], trying to gently move him out of the way, but misjudges her own strength and pushes him face-first onto the ground. He's pulled out huge armfulls of bast and old shredded newspapers, and Drav sees more of the reddish-gold caps spilling out. Drav shouts, "There are more of those mind-control things in here!" 

- Rovlar: Get away from Gluggranok! Move away from those crates!

 Mule wanders over to the cabin and edges the door open and begins to walk inside the cabin. 

 - (Flick) Vengeance, go get your friend there. 
 - (Vengeance) She can handle herself; she's always going off on her own little mini quests. 

Paros has real world experience with horses. Because, you know, his parents get around on horses and there were horses in teh village. Once village horse, Scutterball, loved wild strawberries, which he then noticed with other horses. He sees now that Mule has ignored a large bush of wild strawberries in order to push her head into the cabin. (Vengeance might have fed her three days ago.)

Rovlar notices Drav going into the crates and, "I'm quite serious, I'm going to have to let loose on you." Drav, though, casts shield on herself. For a brief moment, a shining light of armor appears around her and deflects the arrow away. Eldar: "Together we can keep them from hurting us." 

- (Startrella): is there anything you need me to do, here? I'm still on a buzz, but ...
- (Jean-Luc): No, enjoy your buzz, we have things pretty much locked down here. 

Vengeance, suddently becoming aware of the strange behavior of Mule, harnesses his ki to cover over 100 feet in six seconds (sprinting about 15 miles an hour) -- Roxfallanah, what are you doing? -- Mnnaannannnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaa  -- Oh, ok, carry on. [Perception] You can see through the door that there's a shape of a humanoid figure lying on the ground face-up; they have a very large cloak, or wings spread out on the ground behind them. It looks like the thing could be made of stone. -- There could be a cockroach in there, Roxfallanah, and I do know how you hate bugs :: This causes Roxfallanah to back up, and she turns to the strawberries. -- (sotto voce) She did say she wanted to do a juice cleanse. -- (psychic) .. it was actually a juice smoothy .. :: in one of the rare moments, Vengeance thinks, that Roxfallanah manages to get through to him. Having gotten Roxfallanah out of the doorway, Vengeance walks into the cottage; he's able to see that the figure is totally stone laid out on the ground, fairly symmetrically, and that (which he would have learned at the monastery, studying angels and demons) this is an Aasimar. Cottage otherwise has crude bed and table and chair. There is no weapon observable, but their clothing is stone, like their body. -- What a lucky soul, I wish I could petrify myself. :: The distinct sound of a very large eagle carrying a very large frog is audible.

Carlos heals Flick and then swings his war axe at Glugg, who, despite getting slashed, remains tethered to the mortal plane. 

- (Rovlar): If you all could kill Glugg and bury him
- (Jean-Luc): Doesn't Glugg seem oddly defensive of these helmets despite not wearing one? 
- (Paros): guys you too can do really well at stuff if you go insane.
- (Veenock): No, Paros, you're definitely the most sane one here. 

Jean-Luc and Paros see, about two miles north, a huge figure moving very quickly. At 30 feet tall, it's approaching at the speed of oa galloping horse. 

- (Paros): Is it a really big galloping horse? 

It's more like a tower with three rotating legs. 

- (Paros): I hope the martians haven't come to invade. :: He can feel that there's something on or nearby that knows that he is an intelligent creature, and Paros's Third Eye starts throbbing (mental version of hair on the back of his neck standing up). Paros, completely distracted from everything else going on, feels drawn towards it an apprehensive. 
- (Veenock): Hey, baby, why feel anxious. I just told you you were the sanest one here. Doesn't that give you a nice flow? 
- (Paros): Ok well then I guess it's fine.
- (Veenock): Hey, whatever keeps you calm. Although I like it when you're worked up as well. 

Paros tries to ignore Veenock for a minute while the figure approaches. Again, Paros's knowledge of horses comes into play and he judges its arrival in about 5 minutes. He alerts the rest of the party. Flick attempts to focus her elf eyes. Udrek, they see, has slowed down to a light jog, which is still a fast pace due to Haste but is no longer a sprint. Drav's sensitive dwarf ears pick up Udrek shouting -- Master. General. Coming? 

- (Rovlar): Now you guys are screwed. I suggest getting the hell out of here if you want to keep your lives.
- (Flick): We don't know the meaning of the word.
- (Jean-Luc): Yeah, we fight things we shouldn't all the time. This is just another Tuesday.
- (Rovlar): You guys have real trouble with hobgoblin words, don't you. This isn't the first time. 
- (Flick): I can't wait to knock this schtick out of the tree. 
- (Veenock): You're gonna get him this time, I know it Paros. Tune out the haters. This is Paros's "me" decade. This is gonna be fall-down-fight-o-nomics 

- (Veenock): Hold on does somebody have a sweet tip? Did I hear someone talking about investments? 
- (Paros): Veenock how are you talking to Flick?
- (Veenock): Well you'd have to talk to him for me. Or work something out with Startrella? The tip might go stale!

[Paros is not sure if Veenock hears everything that Paros hears.]  
[A discussion of Dexter's Dark Passenger.]

Flick's worst fears come true as Cyrowan gets within 20 feet of Fez. --Don't worry my lord I'm coming! We're gonna get you all tried off and build a fire for you. And get you out of this emotional basement, so I can live there! :: Joan hears the rumbling of the tripod. -- Is it against the law to do studying around here? 

- (Cyrowan): As far as I'm concerned there's only the law of protecting your master: the law of the feudal chain of command. Also the Great Chain of Being. 
- (Startrella): There's also the Law of Cool. 

Jean-Luc moves towards the trees and Hides so as to more effectively assassinate. Rovlar doesn't perceive you. 

- (Rovlar): What'd you do, duck down over there? Pause for a second. Did you whisper something?? I could see you, and then I couldn't see you. A equals not stealth A. Proceed to three-quarters cover, that's the only way you'll defeat me.
- (Flick): i love the reverse pscyhology.
- (Rovlar): no this is regular psychology. 

Drav stomps on Glugg's outreached hand. The hobgoblin reaches out with plaintive eyes; a pitiful hobgolin starign back at her from the ground. Drav, a little worried about Eldar's position on all this, doen't hear anything from her 'imaginary friend'. Flick shoots "normal" arrows through a break in the branches. 

- (Rovlar): you'd be at a tactical advantage if you shot wildly and scared your targets, rather than appearing cold and scientific. It's a tactical advantage to keep your enemies alive, actually! ::Flick listens for a few seconds and fires again: the arrow goes through her "left shoulder" and she spins around. Jean-Luc sees that the arrow goes right through Rovlar's eye, and then her body falls off the arrow; Flick believes that the fall is what kills her.

- (Flick): Drav, I have a piece of Startrella that can cast teleportation circle, but I don't know any destination sigils. But you and Paros read like crazy. Or we can stand and fight whatever's coming. 
- (Drav): it seems really ominous. 
- (Flick): if it's going 20 miles an hour, we could cast the teleportation spell. 
- (Startrella): you can always come back to my pad, you know. There's Elka, where I went through my larval stage. It's a giant ocean teeming with poison. There's Geynor, where I went through my reproductive stage. You're not gonna like that for pretty much cosmetic reasons. There's Si'a though. I should have started with that one because that is where my pad is. There are some humanoids that have to live in bubble cities. and they make do, and they can pretty much turn the wholle place into a giant hot box. 
- (Jean-Luc): as far as whether or not fighting is a bad idea; i think we could take it in a fight. we punch above our weight class. 
- (Drav): It seems to be moving pretty fast. 
- (Paros): We also have the power of friendship.
- (Veenock) don't forget the power of intense rivalry. and grudges. and deep-seated enmity. 
- (Paros): those are good too. wait -- are you suggesting I should have a grudge against this thing?
- (Veenock): look, if you want me to give you advice, you're going to make sure i get some stock tip advice. we could do a quid pro quo or something like that.
- (Paros): Ok, so ... buy high and sell low or whatever.
- (Veenock): i sort of meant specific insider-trading level information.
- (Paros): the insider is YOU, Veenock
- (Jean-Luc): we should tell him to short that distillery ... company ...
- (Veenock): short Tepplin you say? I thought they were up and coming
- (Jean-Luc): Not anymore ...
- (Veenock): i'm gonna talk to some of my floor traders. and seriously, that thing coming towards you has something inside of it: the sweet nougaty insides; although the thing on the outside is a threat in and of itself. also can you ask startrella for some of that fizzlecoke? 

Drav [Arcana 21] knows that teleportation circles are a very specific kind of magic. She does know one in the Steeplepeak Mountains, east of her adoptive homelands of Forest Ogrelodge. The problem is, they are already fairly close to their destination; it's kind of agricultural. there is organization going on around a bay to the southeast . there's one that she's heard about, on one of the islands. But she casts her mind back, and she sees that the fire of the cart has consumed the cart almost entirely; the ashes are still warm, and it looks like they are providing heat to these shards, that before may have blended in with the glass. Light-blue shards; it's the sort of crystalline or glass used to trap something or keep something inside of it. and it has exploded. to keep something incorporeal in it. (Was it in the cart?) Drav tries to see if something has been released. [Nat 20] She can sense that this kind of gem is used specifically to trap angels, and that it's been exploded, and that it was killed, or managed to escaped; they are kept trapped against their will; the deva escaped. They are not here anymore; the pattern that's left is one that looks like the deva -- as if reading the flame pattern from a rocket launch -- used this to return to one of the higher spheres. You'd need a connection to the divine to use this weird kind of teleportation circle. [They would need the same kind of technology to travel to and from a celestial teleportation thing of this different nature. They wouldn't be able to travel back unless they found a similar reverse pattern, even if they had the spells to do it. Even regular teleportation circles aren't terribly common.] 

"Drav the Arcane Queen". She mentions all this to the party while grabbing a crown to study later. Flick connects the aaetheral gemstones from the aetherial plane with what Drav has just spoken of. Flick: The starchild lifecycle sounds disgusting. (Startrella) Actually you just need to think about it from the perspective of accepting the natural world and the natural cycles and you'll be a little less judgmental. As larva, we can't afford to judge each other , since our lives are so precious, but also so meaningless because 9/10ths of us die before we can take our next form. That's only in part due to the ecology of the world, but also how harsh that particular planet it. I've wondered if it was designed to be that hard to weed out specimengs. I haven't achieved the final metamorphosis of brain elder yet, so ... i'm going to leave the contemplation to then. You can really only understand the true name of elder brains by having cosmic background radiation converted into sound waves. i don't have the acoustic equipment . i have this sweet recording studio on Si'a. If you come, I'd love to show you some of this stuff. Just noodle around. 

- (Jean-Luc): there's something to be said for figuring out what's going on with these hobgoblins and the mind controlling helmets; it seems like something we're against on principle. 
- (paros): take the portal to bubbleland, right?
- (star): "take the portal to bubbleland" is one of my favorite albums
- (vengeance): i feel like if we go back to this pad we're going to have to hear a lot of bda acoustic guitar.
- (star): i'm more worried you won't be able to appreciate the acoustic instruments i can play that you haven't even heard of before. i ould try to convey that to you, especially if you were on the right kind of mind-changing substances. this is way cooler than fizzlecoke. 
- (paros): do i even want to know?
- (star): that could be kind of dangerous for you, Paros, you're already dealing with three different minds in one. 
- (paros): what's wrong with that? 
- (star): nothing...? but you do seem like you move at a nice steady slow pace, so if that were to increase, i don't know if you have the cognitive resources to be able to deal with that.
- (paros): are you trying to say that i'm not mentally up to snuff to handle my fizzlecoke.

[2:30]

Flick gets up onto the roof, catches Mule's flank, and scrambles into her saddlebag. Flick uses her primeval awareness: "First of all, thanks very much for being willing to carry us all this way, but it's really important she get us as far away from this thing as possible, and we'll get her all the strawberries she wants" -- All the wild strawberries? You can make a promise. Can y0ou make sure this fishy man gets away from me? (Flick): That's another kind of action item we're going to have to worry about. (Roxfallanah): Action item? you seem very professional. (Flick) Crisis brings that out of me. We really have to get going. -- And then Mule takes off going 60 or 70 miles an hour, somehow leaving no trace of her passage. (Vengeance): How is she doing this having no calories? (Flick) I'll just give her a goodberry or two: I think that should take care of it. 

[...]

[2:40]

WHen Mule shrinks to regular height you're lying face-first on the ground holding the strawberry up behind you, and she licks at Vengeance's balding pattern and takes the strawberry. Joan jumps off when Mule is still 40 feet high and only takes 4 damage because of rage. Drav and Jean-Luc fall off at 20 feet and take 10 damage [failing their DC 13 athletics / arobatics checks]. Startrella, either go big or go home, able to get to Si'a, can't dismount cleverly. Paros and Carlos stay on as Mule shrinks all the way. You are now a mile away from their overnight camp; looking back, they see that the tripod has stopped. Flick [nat 20] can see that it's extended tentacles from itself and it's emptying the boxes into a hatch opened in the back of the cabin. 

- (Flick): this is a very sophisticated piece of machinery
- (Jean-Luc): that just means there's more things that can go wrong, like if we just throw a fireball at it
- (Flick): well we can't be tracked for the next 55 minutes, as long as it doesn't have a line of sight on it. Part of me wishes you hadn't taken the hats ...
- (Paros): But I need a hat.

Paros detects that his third eye is kind of sleepy, and it closes its lid.
