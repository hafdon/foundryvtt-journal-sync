recap
jean-luc thinks lydia is talking about nem and gorph when she says "let's defeat them together". he's suspicous but hopeful that Lydia is their ally.  Jean-Luc knows he's not under the effects of anything; he knows that Lydia is still about 20 feet away

Vengeance still being turned on by Fez's attacks on Mule.

The last Jean-Luc knows is that Lydia is alive. She was the daughter of a merchant and a copper maid? wearing cloth trousers, walking/traveling boots, tunic belted in, hair kept back in a braid, a little dagger at her hip; a utility weapon.

Gorph leaves the area of the land which has erupted in Cyrowan's tentacles.

Nem comes to the rescue of K-Flifph, getting advantage through pack tactics

Jean-Luc comes over to Sneak Attack K-Flifph, cleaving, and using K-'s body as cover while cleaving into Nem.
K-: don't make K stand for kill! we;re the original inhabitants of this place. you're standing on our ancient Burrow-grounds. There didn't use to be a lake here, you know.

Nem: if you go even a step into the lake, you'll see the remains of our Burrow Ground! K-flifph's throat is slit, and on the backswing JL cuts Nem in the ribs.

After K-'s body goes limp, Flick sees that it further deflates after death. flick: so it's an appendage or decoy, rather than a person?

Vengeance: you thought being a cuckold was a bad thing! as he thinks horns sprout from his head, -- in a brief moment of clarity, he knows that thinking he has horns is theatrics. if he wants he can hold his quarterstaff up --- this one time he's able to embrace the performer in him who loves making shitty tunes on his panpipes. or hold four darts out like horns from his forehead. -- he ends up attacking with the quarterstaff and using flurry of blows. he does shake his head, and the leaves fall out of the mitre and he's wearing the branch superstructure. most of running over there, tho, was deciding which of these options to use, and he dropped everything on the way, ending up just using his fists. -- I think you should do somethingn else with your spaghetti hair!

Gorph: This is my body, not spaghetti hair!
Vengeance: oh, well in that case I apologize. (He can see that gorph's body is blueish green because it's comprised of blue-green algae, of which there are collections growing on the edges of the lake. given the time of year, it should be covering the whole lake. Gorph might be an agglutination of the lake's algae) We should keep it away from the algae?
Gorph: I'm a cure for what ails you, whatever that be , probably mortality!
vengeance: so we should be eating you?
gorph: just the extract, which is emanating from my body
vengeance: Seems like poison
gorph: more like mithridatism.
vengeance: are you sure it's in the right dosage?
gorph: yes, the air properly homeopathizes it, and i have to ... when I have to deal with being attacked, it's a bit more difficult, so you're probably experiencing side effects
vengeance: yes, for a minute i was experiencing clarity
gorph: it's all a side effect, tho, of my Goal to devour your Soul!

flick thinks she's lookingi at gorph, but is really peeking through her fingers. vengeance, you see the red corpuscles on gorph's body, all blink and look mournfully at you when gorph says "souls". vengeance: we all have different goals in life; i often make it a point to encourage young monsters like yourself. we're all walking a different path
gorph: some of us hope to walk infinite paths
vengeance: isn't 2 or 3 enough?
gorph: inf [...]
vengeance: infinitude can even be contained in one path, so you should stick to it
gorph: i'll stick to taking as many of your souls as I can

flick's head spinning from the physical "insult" she took from Nem, she has the presence of mind to try to kill the groundhog. (until this day, the burrowlings were cuddly creatures / neighbors to flick's memory). flick further renders Nem's pelt useless by stabbing with the rapier, spins and tosses her shield away, spins and proceeds towards Gorph, drawing her bow, getting within shooting distance of Gorph

Gorph: this arrow has no character I can detect! it's totally tasteless.

[...]

If flick had been less aware, something would have hit Vengeance while missing Gorph, who is taking Vengeance as a kind of cover? who's able to avoid it by using his monkish reflexes honed by sitting still for hundreds of years in an empty stone room.

Cyrowan looks like he's beginning to absorb the toxic aura, and his head swells and ulcerous nodules begin to form on it -- [insight]Cyrowan looks like he's doing this of his own volition, almost like his head is becoming a brain; the tentacles in the square start to wither and retract; meanwhile gorph's legs are strangled together and he slowly begins levitating in the air, and look restrained.

Vengeance: compliments are really going to -- FLick : his head
Gorph: it looks like i was wrong about which of the old spells have an effect on me.

Fez had done so much trauma to Mule's legs that when she goes to kick back out at her, she misses, and then bucks and runs away from him.

Vengeance: did you lie to me? you said that this poison cloud had homeopathic effects.
JL: pretty sure he was just talking about killing you
Gorph: you have to join my body. isn't that homeopathy: you become a single molecule in the infinitude of ...
Flick: pretty sure it's about water memory
Gorph: I have poor memories of the water. I ... stay away from it ... for reasons I don't know.

Gorph doesn't know its "eyes" shift towards Lydia when it says this. -- one of them is a projection of the other, maybe?

Moonbeam, cast by Fez? is on Gorph, and does only half damage . he takes 5 radiant damage.
Gorph: I'm surprised that a squire like this pledges himself to you, paladin, when he's sort of a metaphysical inverse. can't you see from where his powers derive?
JL: this might be a two birds with one stone kind of situation. Gorph goes into Cyrowan, but his tentacles are severed, and the head-brain-sac is hanging there empty; like a drunk with excess skin from above the neck hanging down to his knees, and shoulders and arms plunged into the ground.
Vengeance: see, now that's a hairstyle, Gorph.
Gorph: i'm closer to getting this one's soul, but I think it will leave a bad taste.

Gorph: you're staying far away from my powerful, succulent body.

JL uses bonus action to hide in the rush. JL came from upper middle class, and had formal schooling, so there was a biology unit, but didn't study it in any meaningful way. he's guess that if this were a longstanding lake, but the vegetation looks like it's grown within the last year or six months.

Lydia: Jean-Luc, where'd you go? was this all an illusion? (she doesn't move very far but it looks like she's looking for you.)

JL can hear words probing gently at internal awareness. JL: this doesn't remind me of the Lydia I used to know.

Lydia charms Flick: oh, my elven friend, do you know where Jean-Luc went? Flick doesn't, in fact, see Jean-Luc. 
Lydia: are you talking about the tiny smelly man?
Flick: no, I'm talking about the eldritch horror suspended above the fish-man and the weird monk.
Lydia: yes, what once was human and now is a deflated head?
Flick: he's not my target at the moment.
Lydia: an Eldritch horror? it seems like you're deeply confused; if you come closer I can apply a mental rememdy. can i ask your name? --Flick: Flicksadei brianniel
-- I believe I knew that Flicksadei was a common name. she has a deep acquaintance with elven pronunciation. she is an elf of some sort, or had a very long acquaintance with elves. 
Flick: (in elvish) maybe we can talk more later. Lydia begins to respond in elvish, and catches herself. is that another dialect of common? 
Jean-Luc notices this

Cyrowan is still conscious. he has the spines on crab legs poking out of his body. (even if Gorf isn't real, this is happening to him. Vengeance picks up Cyrowan and brings him outside the poison. This isn't any different than the auras that would emanate from the marsh when his parents would drag him out there in the early morning. Vengeance used to fish for hagfish, which release mucus that expands exponentially in water, so this is nothing for him. Vengeance takes a running kick to see if he can punt him? he untethers him from the ground. it moves Cyrowan about a foot, [he imagines this and then "Next"'s back in time to just use healing on him. ]
Cyrowan huffs about helping.
Vengeance: i don't really remember this boy
Cyrowan: we met under the temples of xanthuc. your delightful friend rotrude was there. such a good friend. we reminisce about her.
Vengeance: it kind of sounds familiar. i'm not great with horribly melted faces. i'll fix you right up if you just hold still. i'm going to cut a chunk of your thigh out and graft it onto your face. we used to do this at the monastery for our electices surgeries when we turned 13. you're going to feel right as rain when this is done. 
Cyrowan: i can't say it sounds orthodox, but whatever keeps me able to assist master fez. [40 hit points]. 
Flick-- you could have... ugh! that would have been so much better spent on me, guys. (waving off lydia)
Vengeance: you're too far away, sorry, he's right here. 
Cyrowan's face re-inflates . "Vengeance, a curious restoration this is. we'll have to sing the tales of bravery and heroicism until the end of time, to all who would hear it. in fact, have you ever thought about taking on a squire? no, nevermind, i shouldn't even think of those things."
Vengeane: I don't know if we're really a match. I appreciate the thought. 
Cyrowan: i'm eternally in your debt
Vengeance: that's ok ... i think you looked better before.
Cyrowan: yeah, there was something comely about it.
vengeance: you'll learn a lot if you stick to me; not too closely, but listen to me.
Cyrowan: so you -- a two-person mastership. 
flick: challenge him to a dual!
cyrowan: rotrude was quite adept at throwing down the gaunlet, from her hands
vengeance: yes
cyrowan: another trophy of your victories
vengeance: i WOULD throw it down, i'm just not in the mood right now. 
cyrowan: you should get out of here; over time, though you have a heroic constitution 
vengeance: well said small boy
cyrowan: we're the same height. i'm human, through and through.

vengeance skips nimbly backwards on his thrush-shoes. 

Flick can see the poison cloud boundary

Gorph "Oof!" on getting hit . your arrows remind me of the infinite void i can recall living in before i came here.
as gorf is mouthing off, I bend the second one into his "soft pallet" -- my final meal, such a succulent shaft going into my mouth. 

flick: lydia, what did you just see happen?

she screams and falls unconscious back into the water. she's fully underwater, but it's shallow. no air bubbles are emerging from her mouth or nose. with the lapping of the water, teh ripples make the image of Lydia disappear and she looks like she's sort of comprised of water, and what her boundaries are. now flick can see through the illusion and can tell that it's some other kind of creature. it's her size and humanoid, but it doesn't look -- it looks like an elf made of water. 

flick knows about Sea Elves, but they aren't made of water like nymphs. they are elves that live next to the sea. like an elf made of jellyfish material. 
[i said no tail here]

she's fallen into shallows; behind her is a deep trench, and then towards the middle of the lake it's shallow. the trench encircles the whole lake. 

flick casts bestial spirit; see form. sort of looks like a tetrapod water dinosaur. flick wants Gerd to bring up with its fin appendages anything, tell her what it saw down there. 

Gerd comes back up to the surface; and dumps onto the bank an animal skeleton; it's waering an arm bracer and very eaten-through leathers. "what else did you see down there", "there were so many skeletons like this, filling the trench. -- you can see the arm bracelet, if I licked it clean" it's shining, a very dark rock or metal that's glistening. "a lot of them were wearing this, or things that looked like this in design. this was the most intact skeleton. some of them are blasted to bits; obviously I haven't lived in a lake, even with the small acquaintance with acquatic life, the water down there -- there are very few, there's not a real diversity of life down there." 
flick: "would it affect me?
gerd: i don't feel any adverse effects besides the oxygen is depleted. maybe a high pH.
flick: all the decomposing flesh in there.
gerd: yeah, something like that.

flick examines the body. skeleton looks like an (vengeance) "probably an armadillo!" from 50 feet away. flick knows it's probably a small animal skeleton. she goes to pull 
gerd: i can tell his favorite animal is an armadillo because he's definitely into leprosy.

vengeance runs over and attempts to spear gerd to attempt to prove to himself and his father he's a true fisherman. flick notices that when vengeance got a taste of that fish poison, he went a little "fish crazy" . he's probably gotten closer by the time flick notices him. flick prepares to do a shove attack with her force arrow. just trying to wound his pride a little bit. -- vengeance has the chance to "catch" the missile with a monk ability. vengeance actually deflects the arrow of force, using his qi. but that uses a reaction, so he can only do it once, . in planhage lake, wall runs into you, which is what flick's force arrow feels like. vengeance congratulates himself, deflects a force bolt, and his footwork gets tangled in his thrush boots and he goes head over tumplins.
why is fishing so hard! he yells. he takes out a tin can on a string from one of JL's beers that he was trying to sell.

"the real spearing of bestial spirit is the friends we found along the way, neither of which is inside of you"

Lydia under the water now looks ... like light passes through her distorted.
when she's out of the water, she's opaque. she looks like a blue elf. her skin is blue, mottled. now that she's out of the water, absene of lines of aging, 5 feet tall, elvish ears. and now that she's entirely out of the water, she has a tail. 

how much does JL know about elves? their aren't a lot of them in human cities, but they're not rare in the world. this could be a haute couture elf, or punk rock elf. 

- jean-luc: once again some fucking creature has read my mind; my past is filled with horror stories and i don't need to relive them. the curse of leading an interesting life i suppose
- flick: there aren't too many interesting people in my past.

gerd pulls Lydia 20 feet inland. flick awakens her, and she can't focus her eyes at first. 
- flick: you're seriously outgunned here, friendly acquaintance. just between us friends, Lydia. do you mind telling me what you intended to do with us?
- Lydia: i wanted to help -- reunite with Jean- what's his name. 
vengeance: Lennon? 
- JL: why Lydia, weird sea creature?

- Gerd: i don't want to go back in the water for now (she points, there's a wave-shaped form with a ghost face hovering about 50 feet from the shore)
- flick: hey there hi there ho there. thanks for the warning Gred
- Gerd: it was more for me. i just wanted ot let you know why i was being skittish.

JL: of all the people to impersonate, why her?
Lydia: when I try to unite with another, it's easier if they are looking for something lost within themselves. when I connected with you and your compansions, yours was the easiest spot to see and try to fill. i've only taken on what you know of this Lydia. they are all just prosthetics to me.
JL: (sort of understands )
vengeance: she didn't mean to "Lydia" on
vengeance: has anyone ever told you that you remind them of rotrude? 

Rotrude ... the memory is ... maybe? i couldn't tell you where or why. was she a hermit of some kind, a solitary creature? some time ago, i can't claim it was rotrude, but maybe someone of that persuasion -- i'm quite muddled now. do you think you could put me back in the lake, it's very difficult oto be out here on the shore.

- vengeance: me?!
flick, kneeling next to her, looks out and sees what Gerd indicated, "ok lydia, you don't bare us specific ill will" -- can you tell me what that is?
- lydia: oh, that's Anghala, she's a water elemental that I met here.
- JL: what is your name?
- Nuphar

- Flick: why are there so many bones down in your trench -- and I don't mean that euphemistically.
nuphlar :i don't know what that would be
- Lydia: they were victims to some event that preceeded me by just a few days -- it's hard to remember. I've been hear for a few months, but I remember an event, an explosion? i saw it from the hills and came here with an old man. He was the one who was a hermit and spoke of hermits!
- Vengeance: was he a monk?
- Lydia: well he lived above us; we all lived in the hills. (She's speaking of the Honied Hills)

Barrow Elves, really only seen in this region of the world, live here, they have a few spiritual centers. Wrentop; Hallux, and the Three Sisters . the honied hills are all populated by Barrow Elves, who have something to do with graves or tombs; there are rumors that they're alves that were once dead, or look over ancient graves from battles long forgotten. rarely show themselves to mortals or non-fey. the fact that a hermit or she is here is very unusual.

They haven't passed craters, or seen blasted areas. JL thinks about how odd it was that only recent vegetation. and thinks: was the explosion so big that it created the lake? what could cause an explosion that large?

Nuphar is still a little out of it, -- yes, the explosion: when i came here, i came down the river. the river used to -- we used to be able to go to the coast. but now it stops here. I think -- that's right.

[nature check] - vengeance knows about this; it was spoken of in the monkish apocalypse. the lake description matches the impact footprint of a meteor. if it happened about a year ago, it's conceivable that fast-growing vegetation would have grown here, especially if it intersected with the course of a river.

- Flick: so the trench could have been an udnerground warren that was -- enough ground was scooped away to reveal it. the burrowlings all died in the blast.
- Lydia: I think i blocked it out. there was devastation, and so much death.
- Flick: then what are those two things that we fought?
  - one of them died like a balloon having the air let out
- Lydia: it struck again, new deaths! she's hallucinating. she thinks these creatures were dead from something else. the memory of seeing this a year ago has caused her to lose her connection.
- Flick: i'm sorry for assuming the worst of you. I hope you get back to where you belong.
Nuphar: oh dear friend, you've always been kind -- i hope these visions one day subside
- Flick: have you tried fizzlecoke?

(as flick examined the body, she sees -- maybe from being taught incendiary marking from Gonfalon -- but the bracers they are wearing evince the definite markings of an explosion that caused deep earth metals to scar and corrode the bracers. ) So what we're dealing with are the survivors of a blast.
vengeance: somebody was fishing with dynamite, and accidentally killed all these armadillos?

[end there?]
