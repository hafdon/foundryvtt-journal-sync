Jean-Luc: Doesn't know either way if Nerch is controlling the other hobgoblins wearing gold circlets.  

Gluggranok and Nerch are sitting on the back of the cart eating lunch, and Udrek sits next to them. Jean-Luc contemplates his Tepplin distillery bottle of hard spirits. [Intelligence not great]. JL is pretty confident Udrek is going to be into an offer to share drink. Joan sits cross-legged, reading out of certification tomes.  

Startrella: Oh, so _now_ you're sharing this stuff?!  

Jean-Luc [History not bad] knows there are some words not to call hobgoblins; (Jean-Luc is proficient in multiple slurs and curses as part of his thieves' cant). The worst one: 
- blidge (the b word)
- 'hobgolem' is not offensive nor inoffensive; it's a neologist ("A Brianniel original")

Jean-Luc goes to share a drink with his "friend" (waffleface - very familiar (tu); frinkle - (usted)): Share a drink with me waffleface.  
Udrek: Just. Spoke. About. Drink. Udrek Teetotals. Drink. Depressant.  
Jean-Luc: You're just drinking with the wrong people.  
Udrek: What makes. Wrong?
Jean-Luc: If you're getting depressed when you're drinking alcohol, I think you're doing it wrong. (He takes a big gulf and offers it to Udrek.)  
Udrek: Haven't. Made. Appropriate. Friendship. Gestures.  
Jean-Luc: In my culture, the first appropriate gesture is to share a drink with someone.  
Udrek: Understandable. But. Personal. Preference. For Stimulants. ... You. Have. Any?  

Flick thinks about her _goodberries-on-the-vine._  (Do they negate the need for food like cocaine? Experimentation is required.) Jean-Luc maay have U.S.S. (urban-style stimulants). Paros has _Haste_? Jean-Luc has a soggy vial of fizzlecoke; Cyrowan probably dripped into it at one point.  

Jean-Luc: It got a little wet, but if you want I've had worse stimulants than this fizzlecoke here.  
Startrella: You got some wet fizzlecoke? I know just the trick. I know how to dry that stuff out.  
Jean-Luc: Oof. .. Yeah, what's the trick.  
Startrella: I guess you just heat it up for a while. You have to make sure you don't burn the coke. You use a dry double-boiler situation.  
Flick: So the trick is evaporation.  
Startrella: Yeah! That's it! Travelling amongst the stars you learn so much physics it can be really helpful. And it expands your minds for those times your mind is primed to expand. (She wanders over).  
Flick: Hey, Startrella, our friend Udrek doesn't want anything to bring him down this early in the morning.
