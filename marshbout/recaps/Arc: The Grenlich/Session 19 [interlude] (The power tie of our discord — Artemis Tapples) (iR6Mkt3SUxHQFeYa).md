# Recap

This was an interlude session helping Curculio find her friend Wodden.

#### Curculio

Flick, Carlos and Joan returned to An Sráidbhaile with Thaz in order to plead with the gnolls to accept her back into their clan. Meanwhile, Curculio approached Drav, Fez and Paros about a message she had been sent by her friend Wodden just after he escaped the confines of a magic lake. Curculio believed that playful flowerfolk were known to swarm to the lake's bittersweet magic and, if seen, could serve as guides. Paros worried that Baphomet posed a serious threat to the flowerfolk. Fez unhelpfully misheard Baphomet as "Bear Vomit."

Paros went on to insult human-fox news in front of Curculio, and admitted that sourced his own news from the psychic manifestation of an evil entity known as Veenock. Curculio mentioned another friend of hers, Zadee (a competent [^verb runt], which Fez believed unlikely until told of the logically rigorous 63-letter alphabet employed by many canids.

Curculio, took a moment to size up Turtle's gastronomical potential, proceeding to describe her home cuisine of [^schilpad stoofpot]. Fez declared himself "His Seaness" -- a necessary ego boost before the kitsune maligned a halfling language orthography for consisting of only "bowls and sticks." Fez was put in mind of Doodril Frogwart's Bowls and Sticks: a Confusing language for a Charming people; an Abecedarium or alphabetical Primer published through Doodle's Toodles, an "young readers" imprint of Frogwart's primary publisher. Curculio mentioned Doodril Frogwart's Secular Healing Clinic in Marshbout, the not-unsuspicious vanguard of a series of similar clinics popping up in the major cities, and the primary distributor of the Secular Ministrations, a copy of which Paros lifted from the Castle Karn library. Drav was able to confirm that Frogwart was not only prolific, but prolithic, as he had penned a few flimflammminy articles on healing crystals. Paros unsuccessfully attempted to recall the method for extracting malt sugar (maltose) from barley, disappearing into one of his familiar reveries and dreaming about the fancypencils he used at the castle. Out of nowhere, Fez, determined to save the face of his people, declared that "in our world, flowers are the children's money."

#### The ghost in the woods

Continuing south through the forest, the group came across an innocuous ghost trapped in what appeared to be an ghostly, evolving maze. When Fez approached, he was recognized by the spirit, which resolved into the likeness of of Cpt. Merrigold. Juna revealed that the death of Von Veen released her from her piscine hybrid form; however, before she could arrive at the ultimate destination on her postmortem journey, she was redirected into the limitless maze in which she now found herself. With Baphomet's influence in play, Drav thought it highly likely that an entity enjoying a boon of Baphomet, allowing one to encase people or spirits in demiplanar mazes, might be siphoning life energy from Juna.

As Fez retreated into the [^seomra crann] to clear his head and bladder, Paros, Curculio, and Drav notioned using Turtle as merely a catalyst and seasoning for a "turtle bath stew." Informing Fez of this upon his return, the overconfident halfling opined on the fox fur stew so favored by halfling-kind. Curculio slashed Fez across the face for this insult, interjecting that her mother had died in the Foxpelt Wars, but then apologized when Fez clarified that the fur in the stew was merely shorn from willing foxes rather than made of their pelts. Paros forgot the difference between the words "hasty" and "tasty" before trying to work out with Fez the mathematics of a hypothesized interdimensional snail for which every journey was "an hour and 50 miles."

### Tusternoof

At that point, the gang witnessed Juna's form torn apart like curtains being drawn open as an entish creature with a motile deerskull for a head, vines and leaves streaming off its body like a tattered cloak, stepped through the opening. Announcing itself as "Tusternoof" or "The twisted one," it attempted to imprison the adventurers in mazes like that restraining Juna. After a debate on the competing merits of halfing, grenlich, and tusternoofian land husbandry, The twisted one provided a possible clue to locating the mirror lake. Paros, realizing the unmined potential of Tusternoof's knowledge, sank deep into its mind as Fez found himself sucked into a mindmaze. Tusternoof unwittingly revealed the 'org chart' of Baphomet's followers (of which he confirmed himself a boon'd lieutenant), including a shadowy cult of [^urush mekh] handling intricate metalwork skullcaps made of a reddish-gold alloy.

Fez harnessed the incredible power of his mind-thoughts and collapsed the carceral psychic construct, appearing back on the material plan in a series of thin slices which coalesced into his physical form -- an event which would certainly not have any future effect on him. Drav and Paros summarily defeated Tusternoof with well-placed blobs of pure elemental energy.

#### Flowerfolk

With the monster dead, the forest sprang to life, and Fez was drawn to a member of the Flowerfolk (or bloemenwet) in a nearby tree. The creature, named Ashtai, resembled a domestic rabbit comprised entirely of pale red and violet flower petals, and declared itself in the midst of its vacation. Paros shattered the tranquility of its aestivation by warning Ashtai of Baphomet's plans to absorb the power of the Flowerfolk. Using Ashtai as a signal booster, Paros harness his bracer to telepathically premonish the bloemenwet on the Slubber, receiving in return nothing but visions of holocaust. Unsure as to whether this was an oracle or had already transpired, Paros communicated his anxiety to the party. Drav recalled reading the minutes of a colloquendo conducted by dwarven geomancers: they had discussed an ancient earth spirit, Mogesh, which was reputed to guard and protect the Slubber. Drav suggested that perhaps Mogesh could be convinced to extend its aegis to the bloemenwet.

The group pondered what step to take next.

# Transcript

all just defeated kolmy thaz being talked into returning to village by flick

Curculio message brought to me by raven ; one of the clues might indicate that might friend might be somwhere around here. they had mentioned something about a lake. after they had been trapped in this area by a lake they couldn’t get out of. wodden (friend) somehow managed to break the spell and get out of the vicinity. and i heard there is a lake nearby like that. it moves around and it difficult to locate. if you know the area well we might be able to

fez intrigued by idea of a body of water that’s not always in the same place. rides over on Turtle.

curculio: riding or eating: fez: mostly riding; it does eat things tho

- the turtle will bite or eat, but won’t be bitten or eaten C: the ones we ate looked like big beach balls. only nominally turtles fez: ball-based C: discovered them near rocks rounded by action of ocean; slide around almost frictionlesssly in trenches. you do have a bit of the sea to you. fez is “his sea-ness”; john sea-nuh

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

halfling is a language, and written infrequently, and fez speaks it dm: language is just the bottom half of the alphabet “bowls and sticks: a confusing language for a charming people; an abecedarium or alphabetical primer” published by doodle’s toodle’s Doodril Frogwart’s juvenile imprint. has these suspicious clinics that pop up . Doodril Frogwarts secular healing clinic in marshbout.

paros already picked up the secular ministrations

fez: is he really prolific? dm: he’s pro-lithic. drav has read some of his rock-based essays

- doodril is a [rock symbol in shape of a g] + nome . his letters are shorter than halfling letters.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

paros tries to remember how to make sugar. from malt?

drav recalls she read something by doodril about rocks. and healing (basically healing crystals) . you don’t need the powers of the gods or magical powers. thought to be somewhat of a crank or weirdo. techniques reminded you of what foldorf was able to do.

i remind angela who foldorf was

drav: let’s go … find this lake i guess

paros falls out of the sugar reverie and can move his limbs. starts day-dreaming about a sweet fancy pencil he was using at castle karn. couldn’t use pens.

drav: curculio, do you have any idea how to find this lake?

curculio: it’s south of Thubudder forest, and i was coming from up north; if you go too far south you hit the coast. i guess we can find someone who knows once we get into that area drav: the lake is not invisible? curculio: yeah, you can see it, but it can trap you within its borders, or move around,

- the lake is “fair” — a knowledge of judicial rationing. it’s fair skinned and around an amusement park (near lake were strange, overly-playful flower children; little animals made out of flowers) if we can find them, we might be able to locate the lake paros: i’ve heard about flower people fez: the flowers are the children’s money. in our world, (halflings) flowers equal dollars paros: there’s a serious threat on the horizon to the FP C: why exhibiting such levity? P: well i heard about it through alternate channels fez: (whispers) “the grapevine” C > insight check.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

[54] paros: well it’s not like fox news C: what’s wrong with my news?! P: i have a strong suspicion that the person telling me is evil. have you ever heard of veenock? C: no. P: this veenock talks to me sometimes … C looks to D and F. drav shrugs. Fez: seems like there’s a lot of that going around these days. not being fully conscious. having strange visions. P: there’s something called Baphomet trying to kill the flower people. C: there’s BAphomet. sometimes people get confused. fez: ohhh, not THE VOMIT ?

dm: i should set sadie up as court stenographer fez: i don’t think she could do it dm: i am offended — the letters are a paw, and you leave out one or more of the foot pads

C: baphomet is one of the demons. [also something called DEMONTS because i mistyped?] P: i think B just wants to eat them C: yeah we would put rose petals in turtle stew back in the home country. i don’t know that i’d try to escape hell to try to do that. P: they could be really good F: [bemused] [tries to contain laughter] absolutely not C: i’m assuming B hasn’t been seen on this plane … ?

I give everyone an inspiration point for figuring out 4-way video

curculio is going to head there now D: i’m in P: sounds interesting C: you may want to work through your psych problems. i’ve heard of this great guy who does non-religious healing. Doodril P: oh yeah C: he used to write all sorts of tracts, but now he’s a commercial enterprise and v/h integrate.

<pre>matt: natural light is wonderful
mick: negative
</pre>

they start walking in the forest see a ghostly presence in the forest 3-4 feet tall; shorter than drav it’s in the underbrush; about 40 ft away looks more like a very worldly halfling

\*\* fez is great at everything (lie)

- good at persuasion (CHA); athletics (+1); insight (so, wisdom)

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

f having trouble telling difference between ghost and moderately sized spiderwebs outside they get shit stealth making quite a bit of noise as they head over looks like it’s trapped in a rectangular space like a roomba that’s moving rooms / cycles through fixed boundaries

ghost: how did you get in here? in this maze with me? i’ve been trapped in this gigantic hedge maze, but i can’t do anything to them C: are you a revenant? do we have to solve a problem? ghost: no, i’m trapped here for some reason. fez: no… ghost: a revenant wants to complete its goal in life ghost: that voice sounds so familiar to me fez: juna?! juna: fez, i’m really getting put through the ringer here fez: what happened at the end? june: the baron was keeping me coherent, and i dissipated, and my understanding is now totally upturned. my spirit was going somewhere, and on the way i was captured and put into this space, an infinite maze. i can’t tell how long i’ve been here.

drav: you know that some of baphomet’s lieutenants have this power. while the people are there, power / life force can be sapped from them. their anxiety and mental struggle generates arcane and religious energy. might be a sign that baphomet’s making stronger roots in the area.

fez: we have to plan an aMAZEing rescue juna: i haven’t seen anyone else; as a mariner, this is a little bit beyond my knowledge C: traveling minstrel, almost fez goes to the bathroom C goes over to the turtle and pokes at it to see if it’s tasty meat =— are you sure he doesn’t eat these?

- a little less meaty than i’d expect
- turtle bath stew? through the turtle out with the bathwater fez gets back C: using turtle maybe as a catalyst for a stew fez: i haven’t had fox fur stew — favored among halflings
- she claw-slaps fez — give him a clawmark paros: we could make a turtle-fox-bath stew

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

my mother died in the fox-pelt wars. fez and you won’t eat my turtle! and we just shave the hair ? C: oh, ok, i guess I over-reacted P; did you say hasty or tasty

> tuesday thursday friday matt works from home >> he did it for a whole year once ; he used to not leave the house for a whole week >>

“an hour and 50 miles”

“it’s like travelling on the back of an interdimensional snail” “because the distance isn’t necessarily a constant”

> catching angela up

fez can understand the turtle but they can’t communicate yet ? it already has a name fez doesn’t know what it is: it has said it to him, but he doesn’t know what it is (in sound) we can understand each other, but i can’t speak his language yet just says “the turtle”

fez rubs his cheek and uses 15 HP NOT what doodril is writing about. it’s absent-minded for fez

> "i'm not in charge of your eurekas”

P: like a baby snake. they dump all their venom.

standing there, attempting to communicate with Juna fez used the tree room contributes to green house effect: slap on an explicit label

fez: how are we going to rescue juna paros: i have a rope, and i toss it to juna merrigold

creature like small ent, but instead of weird ent head, it has a deer skull, and humanoid limbs that are living tree. small living tree with deerskull face, and streaming off of it like a tattered cloak are vines and leaves and vegetative matter.

Tusternoof: no getting your friend out of there; but you’re welcome to find your own ways own Paros: we’re not in there, silly creature

rolling initiative T: “names have no power. mortals like you call me ‘the twisted one’” P: let’s get that Tosser n00b F: can you spell it? T: stick. stick. little bowl. are you getting it?

- no, i’m not gonna spell it for you. look it up in your stupid books fez: how much does “tossernoob” suck T: i suck nutrients up from the soil and stuff paros: why can’t we be friends? t: you want to be friends: come into my house P: sees maze runner / the shining hedge maze paros does 19 fire damage

P: i get it, you don’t get tongue-tied, you’re a wood wind T: i’m not sure how i feel about the wind. as to reeds: they’re ok, they are vegetation. some of my best friends are reeds. P: i know all the best reads T: like, “i like that book”. P: obviously t: so not the reeds by a riverbank that people whisper their secrets into. i know your secrets, paros P: i’m the one that’s literally called “power-os” T: i didn’t call you that, and it’s more of a self-appointed moniker</can>

- i keep the bark on myself

hands that are made of darkness reach through space and time to open a sphere of darkness << seeing who gets out of the way >>

- can hear soft whispers and wet slurping noises

<< mick talks about PDQBOx forever>>

curculio starts flying; things outside the sphere can’t see things inside the sphere

- “im gonna fly” P: backs up at the end of his turn are they talking to each other?

drav sculpts a spell — can only apply to a spell that affects creatures that you can see drav casts expeditious retreat drav - ray of frost ? yes, drav casts ray of frost people taking cold damage from void sphere

matt comments on the quality of the ruler “this one starts at inches”

c: [throws two daggers at tusternoof, both miss but one dagger almost clips fez’s ear] do you know where my brother is? magic lake T: i think it’s a little hard to find. it’ll appear if it thinks you don’t want it do appear. it’s like a pot that won’t boil while you’re watching it. c: ok… t: same pattern here. maybe if someone in the party knows psychological tricks.

d: ray of frost (runs around the ball) [19 cold damage and speed reduced by 10ft] [69 damage done at this point]

T: i feel like i’ve been hit for an inappropriate amount of damage right now t: loses concentration on void sphere, and it sucks back in

f: whips for 0 damage t: give me the whip (my body) and the turtle

curculio has throwing daggers on a bandolier throws one — pierces should and passes through without really injuring T: t: the mage armor is a gift from my patron that allows be to brush aside attempts to bleach my tips f: he has a patreon? t: oh, tell me more! f … t: what is a month …. 13 28-day month f: announcing candidacy for world emperor. one-issue. do this t: any candidacies announced in the demiplane are restricted to the dmeiplane f: ok t: i can award it to you now f: i’m subpoena’ing you t: ? f: has to testify before the council of the fezziwig demiplane t: good luck finding me with a process server f: by our rules and regulations, merely saying “good luck finding me with a process server” is evidence of being served, . t: i don’t remember saying that! p: i do t: shut up! t: god damnit, baphomet’s gonna be on my ass about this. he told me not to get myself involved in any more lawsuits. P: detect thgouhts t: {{gotta get these guys in mazes. —overwhelming urge to consume; starting to figure out how to pull fez and turtle’s essence out—}} P {{where is he in the hierarchy. what does he care about getting done. what’s his role. in the org chart. }} f: aren’t all demonic things intensely bureaucratic p: {{can also now detect juna merrigold a kernel within tusternoof}} baphomet is swiping right on requests to become his lieutenant BATH VOMIT t: he’s gonna hate that way more than i hate ‘tosser noob’ . — better watch out, you might have to deal with the big man p: i’m gonna turn you into a salad t: pretty good burn.

Curculio motions to Paros when he does drum sting with a flute. i’d like to start a band: i’m missing the rest of my minstrels {{T: is someone B: gave powers to ; T: is a manifestation of the urgest for overgrowth of vegetation and raw meat and death and mazes }} paros: so he’s like a demonic farmer? f: we’ll all die like agrarian dogs. t: i’m more like a demonic anti-farmer. i want to grow p: mazes are pretty regimented, dude t: i don’t want the produce to come from the land, i want the the produce to come from what the land traps f: what i’m hearing is … the fungus is inside the circle of life, but it needs ot be outside the circle of life, and everything has to return onto the fungus ? t: oh jesus have you been talking to colmy? she is so confusing — i do think she has good ideas. p: was confusing f: she has re-entered the circle of life if you catch my meaning t: the problem with kolmy — she was fine with vegetation growing into intellectual life , but then she wanted animals to consume the vegetation, and that’s where I diverge from her perspective. f: so it’s like catholic and protestatnt t: i thought that was about transubstantiation f: popes? t: yes, selling of the indulgences p: holy fundraisers P: {{if they can find a way to boost juna’s ability to succeed on intelligence checks; make her more self-reflective; see that it’s a delusions}} {{ also see a subset of the org chart — a bunch of creatures that look like tusternoof, all holding these reddish-gold crowns, tiaras — it far away but still connected — none of them are wearing the crows, they’re just holding them. some of them look more like skull caps with mesh and flanges. }} f: like daddy mac or mac daddy - two members of criss cross. f: consult turtle briefly. he’s divine energy in animal form. — can he sense Cpt. Juna anywhere p: i can sense juna “inside” tusternoof DM: turtle -> these demiplanes aren’t objective. they are internal creations made and sustained by tusternoof. dm: they can think hard enough that they show up on the material plane. but it’s “in” tusternoof and their mind \*\* figure this metaphysics out. F: focus on divine aspects of divine sense.

- wants to see if there’s a way to communicate between the planes DM: tusternoof is kind of like a router. LAN but endpoints can’t communicate with each other. P: T is a switch and a firewall with client isolation. they can somehow communicate out, though. f: we have to hack the firmware p: some of the devices have vulnerabilities that you can discover through port-knocking f: knocking on your back door
- was creeping around the back stair F: fails to get out of the maze t: reaches out arms which become firehose of vegetation

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

\*\* salad shooter: it’s morally ok to store it anywhere the way that fez emerges from the maze onto the material plane is exctly like a salad shooter paros: i love coalescing!

- i should have made this more of a puzzle

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

drav misses with a firebolt t: i calls em like i sees em p: t: but you do respect me a little bit? p: in so far as i’m attacking you and not ignoring you t: you’re right — hurting is always better than leaving people alone to do their own thing paros lights him up, puts him in a sack, and tosses the ashes over his shoulder to get rid of the sins from his past life p: does baphomet have an eye ? dm: he has a bulls head

- tusternoof burns up and into a heap of ashes DM: don’t feel the intelligent thoughts of juna merrigold; as you toss the ashes over your shoulder they briefly form the image of a bulls skull before they fall f: i assume that’s the manifesetation of how the demon anchored himself to the plane. the usual skull in the middle of a pentagram. c: how did we get involved with this guy? p: there was a friend of ours. don’t know what happened.

f: feels liquid dropping on him someone’s cooling unit in a rotted out tree above you f: climbs the tree <sees creature="" living="" inside="" the="" tree="" trunk="" —="" looks="" like="" a="" bunny="" but="" made="" entirely="" out="" of="" flower="" petal=""> angela: “oh!” flower: yeah i’m a flower creature. what are you f: i’m a meat popsicle. just a particularly small one (5th element) f: what are you doing hiding up here. flower: i live here. there are more of us [two or three heads pop out; made of flower petals] f: we hvae strange tidings to bring you. flower: i can see you! paros. you don’t look like you’re as comfortable climbing things paros: no, i can climb. flower: doubt it paros: why don’t you come down here [there’s on sitting on his shoulder already] flower: this is what happens when you try to get in a contest with flower folk paros: i guess you’re pretty good at contests then flower: this has taken a real abstract turn — i mostly thought it was weird even talking about you climbing the tree paros: there’s this guy baphometthat is really good at eating flower folk. and he’s probably in the area or going to be in the area soon. coronavirus for flower folk. flower: there’s a whole community on the slubber. this is just one of my vacation homes. — do you have a way of getting a message there for me fez: up in the tree; reminds me of a ship’s mast p: if you hop on this bracer, i could channel a message through you to your community. at serious personal risk to myself! flower: what’s the risk . you just seem kind of neurotic p: each time i use it i get closer to some kind of boundary between sanity and madness. flower: you’re being so concrete, … but nevertheless I’m a little lost</sees>

curculio to drav: would you accompany me south to look for wodden?

- do you know any way to implement that trick that tusternoof mentioned for finding/not finding the lake p: sounds like insanity d: so does that mean you’re volunteering

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

flower: did you say harebrained? p: that’s where hair comes from — the brain flower: so you aren’t up on the spelling p: no, i know how to read flower to drav: does he know how to read drav : we;re not sure. sometimes he goes blank and just — not sure what’s going on in there. flower: i’m a little worried about getting on his bracer. is there something you can help with drav: my spells run more towards damage paros: anyway of course i know what harebrained means and how to spell it. and it’s totally ok to try this bracer magic. if you’re in contact with the bracer, i can use that to channel the telepathy. you’re basically ilke an antenna to your community. flower: it’s not going to hurt? paros: not at all! [deception check: nat 20] paros points his arm out straight P: think of someone who is of importance to you in the community flower: it’s farfal. farfal is kind of shy , maybe i should be …. no, we can both try to reach out to her [paros wild magic surge — he doesn’t get it]

mind — in pain — countless numbers of its fellow — burned alive — the creature is thrashing about in pain

paros wants to heal from a distance but only has a healing potion

\*\* rules for getting into contact with dalariel. paros tries to lose self in self. like when he read that book before, and other times he’s been contacted. semi-meditative state. paros trying to meditate.

- resources out

- paros does wisdom check — angelic form of dalariel

- “you’re always in touch with me. you’re standing there agape.”

- P: can we help these people

- Dalariel: the FF may be the next group of refugees,

- DL: they need refuge in places that are immune to baphomet’s incursions. all they desire is to live in forested areas.

- P: i have an idea!

- zorbowood can act as a backdoor into certain planes (juna merrigold / baphomet / tantegorisch)

- F: doesn’t like feeling of powerlessness not being able to help a whole race of people.

- P: can they come with us ?

- DL: there are a lot pf them, and they aren’t particularly mobile, and are very fragile.

- D: so what about tobolux … toblerone DM: toblerone is part efriit and part flower folk. — and part oklmuk - or ephphatha D: is there anything we’ve read so far that … safety in unity against baphomet.

    - flashback to do religion or arcana check on reading things (maybe a new flashback / reading / learning from books check)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

the wards that the townsfolk set up to banish tantegorish might be what you need; or you might be able to work a deal with other deities that could protect the area. transcription of the xanthu tablets - old baphomet isn’t an elemental, but his power resides in the flora of areas. but also, in guts and viscera and war and confusion and things like that. he can be countered by elemental-type spirits that are the inverse of that; for instance, karnish was an earth locus; could establish an area that was safe from baphomet.

- also found: symposium that was held a few decades ago, by dwarven geomancers: touched lightly on the area around marshbout where the flowerfolk were living, and under there is … they’d been trying to comunicate with another earth spirit Mogesh (classic mogesh) at least 5000 years old, and an earth elemental associated with maintaining boundary between land and sea near marshbout; used to be part of a greater entity that was split when buggsush resided in the marshbout bay and shattered the ligaments between the different earth spirits there by living there for so long. mogesh is powerful enough that it were re-invoked it could probably protec the FF on the slubber
- they don’t know if paros’s telecommunication was a vision or live
- paros doesn’t even know what kind of information he’s getting back.
- dalariel hasn’t had any real-world effects; could be something he’s completely making up

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

the one on your shoulder’s name is Ashtai drav: does ashtai think this is currently happening ashtai is shaken up, but they got the same images that paros did. paros wants to know if he’s self-aware enough to tell that from vision and himself

insight into himself: 12

- skeptical of being skeptical fez: that happens to the best of us. not me, but the best of us

fez: flower people hunted by an inter-planar minotaur BEAR VOMIT
