# Recap

Flick, Drav, and Paros are whisked to the Forest of Horth where Joan has just teleported on an archaeological expedition for some dragon/dinosaur bones to find out about the ancient enmity between giants and dragons. They kill a necromancer, Feniendum, and her newly animate pet Nugget, while discovering that Graal is under the sway of Feniendum and is succumbing to a necrotic zombification disease. They bring Graal back with them to the skirt of Seomra Crann after promising to heal her.
