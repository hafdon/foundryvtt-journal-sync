## Carlos engages Gegathon in light conversation

- G: Druids have had me trapped down here for a few years now

- Carlos: why can they use ballsack power to trap you?

- G: what? i've been trapped underground.

- Carlos: we destroyed the trap, and welcome back

- Gedathon: the brains surrounded me in an evil circus of bondage.

- Flick: like the insane clown posse ?

- G: i was separated from my posse. without a hengest . or a party invitation. i could feel its inverse hanging just on the other side of the world.

- C: how long?

- G: hard to tell. fiends lose track on the material plane.

- C: where's home:

- G: home is just metal hell.

- C: that sounds lovely. do you need help getting back to your volcano?

- G: once i kill the druids i can find my way back

- C: we already destroyed a decent number of them.

- G: if they were all gone, i would have an intimation. there must be some still around.

- Flick in game still hiding

- C: what's your backstory with the druids?

- G: we don't have any competing projects. trying to get orange pastemaker within their grasp.

    - this is Hengest the Violent (munching on brains)
    - Hengest hasn't said anything.

- C: to G: does H speak?

- G: when H is with me, she obeys

- C: well you can obey while having a mind of your own. but … not a talking horse ?

- G: don't all horses talk?

- C: i wouldn't say all. well the horse was doing a lot of talking until now.

- G: this horse communicates primarily through violence, as its moniker might suggest.

- C: that's a valid mode.

- G: are you saying that violence against others is a healthy mode of expression? I certainly like this guy.

- F: our cleric, ladies and gentlemen

- C: anyway, we should be friends! -- aren't you out of your prison? is the world your prison?

- G: something in the structure of this arena that makes it a runic area of bondage. title: "not the kind of bondage you might be thinking of"

- Flick (title): "can i roll to see where this guy is going with this?"

- dm: he's not pressed for time; doesn't see his primary foes. he's acting superior; acting supercilious. still has blood in his eyes , so might not see anyone but carlos

- carlos: what is it … that keeps you here ?

- G: the difference between the physical and the magical / "spell-like" are elided to a great decree.

- Carlos: ok, so it's basically a spell

- Jean-Luc: are we seriously thinking about letting this guy out?

- Flick: to JL: do you have ranged weapons? JL: yes. F: let's take pot-shots at him.

- F: and he's riding a hellbeast!

- C: i have a team here with me. they want to know that, after you kill the druids, will you go back to the volcano, or kill people in our world?

- G: i'm not sure it's your concern.

- ian reminds jake that the druids offered to help us deal with the peryton if we killed the nightmare, because we didn't want unicorn to be constrained

- jake: i don't trust … the druids

- carlos is chaotic good

- ian: you are literally the opposite alignment of this creature

- jake: i feel like we've established that the usual alignment things don't apply

- dm: carlos is a racist and a xenophobe

- jean-luc: what about the nightmare makes you want to trust him?

- C: what makes you think that he doesn't just want to go home?

- Ian: primary foes mention, and trapped on material plane. [too much meta-talk]

- Flick: executing readied attack action: establishing that Flick hits and throws Hunters mark

- G to C: call your friends off [ G pinpoints exactly where each of you are located]

- Paros smiles and waves

    - G's eye flashes a bolt of flame intimidatingly.
    - Paros appears very friendly, and genuine.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick: so am i alone on this one?

- Jean-Luc: i'm not sure this should be considered "pre-emptive"

- dm: not clear to G that you're trying to be friendly

- Matt: but it's not clear to him that i'm NOT

- fez [nat 20 religion check] : can see a large shadow that's hovering just behind him, and he's infused with the power of it, that this is the demon sorcerer tantegorisch's image, behind Gegathon. and is an anti-paladin.

- paros: could it be a friendly anti-paladin ?

- dm: the meta-communication was actually happening through Paros as a switchboard; paros felt in his forehead a bulge

    - paros: is it an electric guitar ?
    - light/dark in spot, and electro-magnetic spectrum, and sounds like electric guitar.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- paros casts haste on fez.

- then paros tries to meditate technique to relieve headache (wisdom perception check) : [24] after using inspiration.

    - feel like he could harness the spot to do something for him. highlights each of the people in vision, and projects images (evil eye: sleepy, paralyzed, fearful, poisoned) -- spot on forehead is no longer there, and no more visions.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- genitals made out of tree latex

- G: enlarges and burns; 30 foot high giant pyre of horse and man: within hearing, make charisma saving throw. DC 17.

    - seeing the fire in between your ears and your mind; (blind if lost)
    - passed still has disadvantage.
    - mind-callous develops on those that passed. mind-gloves and mind-hands. (fez)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Fez tells them that gegathon --- has connection to Tantegorisch. comunicated to fez by another power. if fez spoke, could T hear him? Fez doesn't know -- he'd have to make a warcana check .

- Fez: channel divinity to turn faithless.

    - Gegathon failed. !! so he's turned.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Fez holy symbol: thing he washed up on shore with

    - fez just burbles some underwater words
    - flick: what a beautiful language! so subtle!
    - G: you little bastard, i see what you are now. i'm surprised even those incompetent druids let you get in here.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav dips a bunch of daggers in holy water and gets ready to chuck them at the hell knight.

- G: i hate being surrounded by this much goodness. where's that litle dwarf?

- C: you blinded me!

- G: it's burning off your vision of this disgusting holiness. soon you'll be able to see the scape that I do. {{i don't like how my voice drops off -- doesn't be encouraging to other talk}} -C / G: what do YOU know about tantegorisch

- G: if you fight with me, i'll tell you all you want to know about Big T. T-Gore.

- Hengest, glowing with deep red flame, attacks Fez [20 bludg, 17 fire]

    - G: yes, HENGEST, give it to him with those fiery hooves! -- rushes back , Gegathon jumps on, and they disappear.
    - Fez gets OA, hits

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Jean-Luc can now move under own initiative; since exuviae turned into hengest.

    - tries to meditate. sees inferno of flame; silhouettes behind that; looks like looking at things through a blazing fire.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- jean-luc basically passes on his turn

- flick and carlos get in a fight about healing people

    - flick: "flick is not at the point where she regrets firing at the hell knight"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- C: [9] fails. so casts lesser restoration to cure blindness. - C: when i think about fez.

- title: "we'll always have hengest"

- F: did my hunter's mark wink out? ADV on perception and survival checks.

    - tries portal .. sense ? activate? no idea where they are. dm: not on this plane anymore.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick: passes saving throw. (can't hide as BA yet)

- Paros tries to make "guitar thing" come back dm: last time it emerged when you were telepathizing and got overstimulated

- Paros tries to reach out with my mind and 'triage' to see what their status is

- eye integrates with normal perception; but he's seeing their embodiedness rather than …

    - oh, just share it with jean-luc title: just don't call me late for paladinner

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- dm: jean-luc wont' be able to see what paros does. Jean-Luc: religion check. something about paros's eye feels not right to him.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## the worm

- Carlos is grappled on top of a worm as it tunnels through the arena.
- Fez: did that asshole knight summon this worm on us ? dm: the knight couldn't have summoned it, because he's turned. (can't take actions except to dash or dodge)
- Fez: how thick is this worm?
- Paros: oh . my. god. look at that worm. dm: 6 feet in diameter dm: carlos, you can feel it dragging you through the earth

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

flick: 18 to hit. 23 bludgeoninng damage. (half flick's health - stinger - doesn't poison him) dives under the ground and up to fez fez: tries to pull carlos off (dwarf catching: 15 to dwarf catch)

- grabs ahold of carlos, and wrenches him off the creature [ :journal stinger, dripping with flick's flesh, retracts back into the worm] carlos is built for getting dragged through the earth fez: like the most dwarf thing ever [ :journal: should have given carlos some info about the worm digging / rocks]

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

the worm has gone completely underground. discussing how far outside the arena to get

scrobs: i can't believe i'm seeing old meenow; old meenow lives in the flipped world

- i've certainly never seen her before.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

dm: worm wasn't technically a lair action. jean-luc didnt get all his clothes back? but he had them in his hands.

while i'm in the bathroom: they want to deal with the worm; and think they will have to deal with Gegathon down the road

- (bone wizard): veenock
- but jake was talking about naphula Mick: Paros is the most insane character. jake: we've got a new naphula

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

drav casts erupting earth. on the tunnel. 20 feet down (Because it's visible). "she who heard it, dirt it"

- earth erupts in a column, and you can feel this entire area, starts to crack and buckle, and it all collapses into a huge hole, that's … big. (the size of the wrestling pit). carlos: good thing no one was standing there. - starting at the orange pool there are gigantic staircases that go down into the earth drav :what?! carlos: what about the geniis on the island? dm: only one of them is a genii, and that's because it's part genii. drav: how deep is the whole? dm: i describe the cavern.

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

carlos: sounds likek a toilet dm: yes, it's an infinitely deep toilet with two balustrades flick: title: the toilet of the gods!! scrobs: this is new to me!

## 2:52:10

- pools are now the stairways, leaking the orange creamcheese.

- scrobs: the druids live here, in the forest. i'm not sure daealla's even going to show up in one of these puddles

- Carlos: is there a druid village nearby?

- Scrobs: this sort of is the druid village; there's 12 - Flick: 6 now …

    <!-- -->

- Scrobs: there's the other village they talked about leaving Aphelia in

- Carlos: let's go downstairs:

- Flick: (title) Old meenow is going to eat us alive! - i'm chagrined that worms are letting … there's a giant worm that can reach us at a moment's notice

    <!-- -->

- Carlos: if we stomp on the ground.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

ian: how was the worm moving freely, under the arena, if there wasn't earth for him to move through

- or it didn't know …

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## god damnit i missed a bunch here. ^^^

- carlos heals flick
- dwarves check out rocks: usually very deep under earth, at roots of mountains and seas. look constructed at top, can't tell going down.
- fez recognizes that they are musty and unused for a long time.
- flick uses primeval awareness to see if garglemon is in the vicinity
- gegathon ?
- flick detects him on ethereal plane; just cooling his heals until turn effect ends.
- jean-luc, no longer blind, climbs to the top of a rock.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

gegathon starts climbing up out of the tunnel. (cantering up the stairs)

- G: that was a nasty little trick you pulled back there. good thing H has my back, i could just take off for a minute.

- the worm will stick around if she gets a taste for you

- C: is daealla down there?

- G: daealla and i know each other very well. we're not buddies.

- C: we want tottalk to Daealla. is she down there?

- G: not really. what i did was … well i came back on the stairway for dramatic effect, from the EP. what , do you think I'm crazy? i'm not gonna do that to my horse.

- C: so you don't know what's at the bottom of the steps

- G: well if you don't know, i'm not going to tell you (panicked)

- C: we don't want to go down there right now because we were being attacked by a worm. what's your strategy vs. worms

- G: i just told you that i sikk'd old meenow o you.

- P: what did you see? / though thinking

- G: i just think it's more interesting if you're surprised when you go down those stairs. [thinking: i hope they go down there and get themselves killed]; [maybe i should be nicer to this stupid dwarf: i could definitely get him on my side. it's so much more fun to treat people like pieces of shit though]. Flick: i'm gonna shoot him again G: yeah I'm gonna try to murder you assholes. C: i feel like neither of those options is productive at this point. D: killing G … seems productive Fez: can we deal with one character per turn getting killed? D: we can just stand back and snipe him. C: should we put up a warning sign? JL: i like that idea: Flick: (title) caution: death knight is possible C: i think we're going to take off, I guess D: wait, is that our conclusion G: hey, cool guy (carlos): you're supposed to be helping me out C: i don't know what either of us have to offer each other G: i have some cool holy items in my … saddle … purse. come on over here and take a look! Fez (title): you call it a 'saddle purse' ?! - call it literaly anything but that G: saddle … bag? bag is such an awkward word Fez: side satchel G: what am i, a hipster? Fez: a little. you smell bad, are wearing flannel under your armor. you just walked up from underground for dramatic effect. look disheveled. G: hipsters like to pretend they're not doing things for dramatic effect. Fez: it all comes back around. C: wait, does he smell bad? Fez: he smelled like sulfur and brimstone. G: you assholes all smell like cheese oil, Fez: that's not our natural scent G: i dont' believe you. C: i'm not into holy items. D: hey carlos, has Aule appeared to you at all? C: I'm more psyched about snacks. [waiting on religion from C : [14] ] Flick: to JL: should we just shoot him?

    - hops off stone

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- actually pick up with JL -- G: there's a golden-haired little favorite boy over there; JL shrugs and fires the arrow

- JL hits

- Flick would have to make investigation check to to see if he's still hurt from arrows he broke off - flick as ADV on attacks

    - w/in 30 feet, gets the planar hook, and 2 arrows. at ass. so goddamn fast.
    - claps Hengest with spurs: horse flicks mane, and huge wall of bloody fire comes up, and force arrows partially break up before can be hit.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- G: there's more where I came from too, it's called: all of hell Fez: do you even know flick's name?

- G: hall does Flick: now he does Fez: who is hall? G: HALL. he runs a theater down on 1st and Main.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Flick: I've done 3 times as much damage to him as any other party member Paros: heightened lightning spell, so DIS (knife lightning -- lightning with little knives on it) - 30 damage. G: i wish i could have said that this empowered me, but it did not. G: does the charisma thing. failures: paros, JL, flick.

beautiful will'o'the'wisp lights; miraculously gorgeous flame-steed; feel compelled to get as close to

- charmed

- have to use movement to move closer to him.

- fez casts bless as level 2 spell, flick, carlos and fez:

- scrobs: i was looking forward to being blessed !!

- fez: next time!

- scrobs (journal): i don't want a next time of this.

- Drav: casts cold spell. which melts in the intense heat of his halo.

- G: i like that frisson of cold; maybe we can make a masseuse arrangement;

    - one dwarf is my jester, the other my massage therapist.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- G is too quick and rides out of the AOE

    - hoists a fire lance and tries to joust on flick, flick gets burnt and knocked unconscious.
    - dismounts from Hengest and tries to go for the paladin;
    - fez sees that his lance shortens into a Sword. s-word.
    - hengest rides back over there. (hengest is doing all the movement)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- scrobs hides.

- carlos: yes, fez ,get a mantis shrimp. dm: hengest takes off, and he's 40 ft. up in the air.

    - scrobs is leaking his sticky and slippery oil . carlos [CON 21]: feels very nauseous but chokes it back and doesn't add to the puddle
    - casts pFG&E on self, and blessed.
    - used to having Aule appear on the material plane; you hear: "Why are you trying to get in league with this guy?"
    - "Just … watch yourself, cause it got a little tenuous out there before"
    - Carlos: i was trying to avoid a fight Aule: this dude is pretty miuch an embodiment of death carlos: i thought if we didn't piss him off he'd go back to his volcano aule: it's not like he's the most morally complex creature you've ever encountered. carlos: obviously he's evil, but i didn't know if he intended to cause evil here. if it was beneath him. aule: let me know if i have a coward for a follower, and we can re-discuss our working relationship. you know you're a cleric, right? carlos: i think there's a limit in crossing over into foolhardiness. aule: sure, you can be diplomatic and at the same time uphold the clerical values.
    - ok, well … good talk carlos: advice? aule: yeah if my brother comes around, try to avoid talking to him you know … Dagdo; he's a real asshole; he's always wearing shades and trying to get people to smoke up with him aule: your friends have convinced you to take the ethical high-road. carlos: thanks for stopping bye aule: my dubious pleasure carlos : [20] - goes over to flick. Gegathon: "horse god" ? i like that! jean-luc: bonus action to disengage. (so he can leave without taking an OPA Gegathon: (journal) the beautiful man comes to me and misses; if beatify sees beauti superior it cowers

jeanluc sees that he doesn't have genitals, and no armor in that area carlos: how come aule has such a stick up his butt today? fez: that was baby brother and pot smoking extraordinaire doo-doo. carlos: i want to make dogdo my deity.

- only move 15 feet a turn;
- superior persuasion (can poison opponents)
