# Recap

## Making camp & breaking camp

The adventurers, now numbering seven (Hieronymus, Flick, Fez, Paros, Drav, Carlos, Jean-Luc), and coddling a weakened Jean-Luc suffering from 'the orange colic' made their way unassailed up to within a half-mile of the Kashte'a River to pitch camp. In the early morning, Flick found herself for the first time by another elf unrequiring of nought but a daily trance. Hieronymus's importunate jonesing for a novel deletery[[1]](<http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn1>) arrested a friendship in potentia but catalyzed a chary trance which began a battue[[2]](<http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn2>) out of a nearby goblin named Bampot. After being patronized by Flick and unsatisfactorily reassured as to the group's grithfulness[^grithfulness], Bampot was first mistaken for one Feekus by Hieronymus. They soon discovered their shared identification as goinfre[^goinfre] with respect to animal and vegetal poison, and Bampot introduced Hieronymus to the practice of bakhaqalaj[^bakhaqalaj]. The petitory[^petitory] cobalus[[3]](<http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn3>) then asked if the recumbent party wouldn't mind removing themselves from the beautiful yellow liefly[[4]](<http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn4>) mafflegold flowers (some leaking a sanguine sap) which had been crushed underneath their bedrolls.

## Getting acquainted

As Hieronymus proceeded to dig up the entire clearing in search of ptomous[[5]](<http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn5>) tubers, Flick engaged Bampot in political discussion, inquiring as to commercial and social relations with the residents in the periphery of Lake Goading. Bampot spoke about established trade routes between the goblin myrkkyasiantuntija[[6]](<http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn6>) and experimental chefs in town; a local temple to Axissa, the Mother Goddess; and the structure of the Seomra Crann which, according to him, was a hundred-foot-tall living hedge topped by a diverse aviary.

## recap of session 24?

- fez, turtle, new storm power

- carlos hammer is sledge hammer wrapped in duct tape and - smells like stale tobacco

    - Dogdo was the chill dude communicating; Aulë was the one a little more uptight. depending on ethical approach to situations, you have better or worse access or one or the other.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav cast cloud of daggers, Aulë approached Drav and offered to cooperate with her. the daggers are now created by Aule struking celstrial steel on anvil, and it shoots out as daggers that do radiant damage.

- hieronymous tried to bad-pipe, but the roll was so bad that it was good-piping (good bagpiping); but later when Mule kicked him against Jean-Luc and it broke one of the bagpipes.

- Killed Hengest, Gegathon started crying, eventually defeated him

- Fez came to with new Storm powers. - aura grants …

    <!-- -->

- exuviae did not come back when Flick drowned gegathon

- Jean-Luc acquitted self well

- Hieronymous offered everyone his coins, split evenly. scrobs stoll one (all got 5 gp)

- daealla wasn't much help in getting back to her, but with Drav, learned about 4 sites of mystical empowerment which had been reactivated when they banished TG 25 years ago.

- hieronymous mandrake root - carlos made an interesting equation between gegathon and mules, because they are both sterile

- H mentioned looking for book necronopticon or nehpilopticaon, and nephil mts probably a good spot to check that out.

- Carlos: one of the cultural relativism of the world. ability.

## Hieronymus butts in and ends up tripping

- hieronymus asks if flick is doing poisoning. it's one of H's favorite activities. i have 10 darts that could use a bit of poison. - flick puts mistletoe on it to make H think he's poisoning them

    - flick 8 deception; H insight 11. doesn't think flick putting on same poison. thinks mistletoe is because flick wants a smooth

    - H: "i can tell when i've been fooled" . (closing eyes tightly and puckering to the fullest extent"

    - Flick: takes small shield on the ground and deflects him by the face away from her

    - H: you have such metallic skin!

    - Flick: you know what, H, you're alright. if i TURNIP anymore, i will make some for you. - I use this! (fizzlecyst blood concentrate. smells strongly of … fishy eely smell, but a very nice petrichor undercurrent)

        <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick to H: do you know how to make poison?

- H: no … but I enjoy tasting it. i like to swish it around, detect the notes, and spit it out. - takes a nice big swig, and swallow about half the vial.

    <!-- -->

- flick: you're not going to be able to taste your meals tomorrow

- H: i wasn't planning on eating for 4-5 days

- Flick: is that something your religious order demands?

- H: it's a spiritual cleanse.

- (there is gluten in the poison; the fizzlecysts eat a lot of rock crackers)

- H: make delicious cookies!

- Flick: it's all tied up in poison right now (all Flick's assets) -- and blood, and 8 pounds of pennies. so eager to get to north bottle and trade fizzlecyst futures on the market.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## hallucinations: Hieronymus circles the grove and the "appearance" of Roxstallana

- mule now looks like Roxstallana to Hieronymus. - H wanders around clearing shaking his quarterstaff and screaming.

    - Flick -- i take it that's not a euphemism?
    - Galen: no, it's both.
    - H: screaming : "Show yourself, Amabelle!"
    - Flick to mule: "is he ok, does he do this often?"
    - Mule: his obsession now is to find her. it's his obsession.
    - Flick can tell that Mule is ensorcelled.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## the battue of Bampot

- long-nosed, long-eared, slate-blue goblin face. it's had to back up because of Hiero's gyrating.

- Flick: there's nothing to worry about (YET!) why don't you come out and tell us what you want. - bampot wants reassurances that they won't be hurt

    - flick calls bampot "Sweetheart" .
    - you might go after my family !
    - flick slings bow back onto shoulder.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- bampot: what's this guy doing with the stick tho?


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## Carlos heals Hiero after all make intelligence check on tobolux

- H sees deer with horns poking out front of face.

- I should find some way to relate this to Baphomet and/or the Horned God

- Carlos (Jenny) asks if Hiero looks like he's enjoying the trip or wants help. - Hiero is having pretty vivid, poison, not magical hallucinations.

    <!-- -->

- Mick: what about our Djinn friend in the bottle ? - Jake: I thought our one question was supposed to save the geniis

    - bottle never destroyed; tobolux part ifriit, tobolux, and oklmuk
    - as Carlos rubs the sand bottle, it becomes liquid, of the same colors, and pulses, but nothing more happens.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Carlos: I guess I have to do this myself! (hrumph)

- lesser restoration.

- Hiero sees truth of things now.

- Hero thinks it's the same goblin he was friends with for 40 years as a small elf before he joined the monastery. perhaps he has found me at last. we've been reunited. (saying this out loud, apparently) - [int check 6]: it's definitely that same goblin

    <!-- -->

- H: Oh, Feekus! finally we've been reunited!

- Bampot: who the fuck is feekus, i'm bampot.

- H: i'm afraid my comrades and I shall have to destroy you.

- Bampot: why?

- Hiero: I don't like goblins like Bampot

- B: it's pretty common in goblin circles

- Dat'tar and BubHot and Bantob

- H: would you like to break bread with us,

- B: to partake of Bacakaladj? (some kind of poison cuisine)

- H: i fyou give us even one small dram of poison, we will do your bidding for all eternity.

- Carlos: NOPE.

- H: nope? oh, it seems like i was mistaken.

- Bampot: do you often pledge yourself to something for very little in exchange?

- H: are you sure you're not Feekus? you seem to know me very well.

- Bampot: we're more anti-authoritarian

- Fez: there's something weird about this guy (H)

- H: yeah, i think we need to get rid of him

- Bampot: you're camped on one of my favorite sites for finding this particular plant.

- Fez: ??

- Bampot: it's mafflegold. (beautiful yellow flower you've crushed with your sleeping mounts)

- he and fez argue about what are weeds

- B: the roots are really what i'm after

- Fez: we used to eat things other considered these. but not these, these are definitely weeds.

- Fez: getting a weed in your eye is quite painful

- Flick: Yes, Onfalon said that weeds are just a misunderstood plant. - (looking around for more goblins)

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## two more goblins become noticeable

### goblins want to get at flowers

- Flick: nothing to be scared of
- should have had a performance check against their … insight?
- other goblins: did he ask you to move off the flowers? we'd share some of the roots with you.
- flick: are they mandrake roots?
- goblins: no.
- flick: if this is where you forage, you have a right to come in and take it
- goblins: sometimes it can be a bit difficult with just the three of us.
- flick: (sarcastically) well we have hiero here, a noted poison expert
- H: (digging already, but in wrong spot)
- flick observes them: "do you find it hard to live this close to a large human population"

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### goblins trade with humans, and get along with them

- goblins: the humans make living off lake, primarily. thubudder is very large and we also are just as comfortable living underground, so we have caves and rock homes. they don't hunt goblins or bear us any ill will. we don't get a whole lot of visitors. we do have a connection wtih one of the restaurants in town -- one of the more experimental / avante guard chefs. we have ways of neutralizing some of the poisonous effects, so we can cut the poisonous glands out, and provide them with the non-poisonous flesh.
- flick: we're in the area chasing a rumor about a place of power. about druids.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### information about the druids in seomra crann

- goblins: main druids in seomra crann -- like a living building. we do actually give them some of the things that we can find and harvest, and they use them more for spells than food, but we do a trade with them.

- flick: are they friendly?

- goblins: they're … weird.

- flick: what would you say their aesthetic is?

- bampot: oh yeah, i know who you're talking about. they're off the end of the scale. the ones here are just tree huggers. - the village nearby has a temple to Axissa. she's the main mother goddess for seomra crann.

    <!-- -->

- flick: does her repertoire or symbols include thongs and … ?

- bampot: the upper reaches of the structure is sort of an aviary for birds of all sorts. i'm not sure if they have a magical relationship with them.

- [Ian: the evil mailman (Budduck) who was using polymorphed quicklings. ]

- bampot: the temple is in the hamlet

- Paros (Jake) : in what was is their house alive?

- bampot: it's essentially a 100-foot-tall hedge.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### hieronymus has dug up half the campsite.

- H: no weeds! but i did find this pile of bones and the corpses of six adventurers with tiny goblin daggers plunged into their hearts. -- or corpse of one adventurer.

- Carlos: check if they are bones, and if H is still hallucinating.

- [H, your knowledge of goblin daggers is based on interactions with Feekus -- which wasn't even his real name]

- Carlos: 25. H is looking at rock bones, like somebody was literally petrified. or some other chemical event took place. and he's no longer hallucinating. the "dagger" is also stone. it looks like a flint-daggers with the scalloped edges. the rock wasn't naturally formed; it's rock now but the rock itself is 20 years old.

- bampot: these actually mark where the mafflegold flowers are sometimes, but we don't have any way of telling what it is. we've seen others in other parts of Thubudder. there are people in Skimming who've looked into it. they might have info at the natural history museum or one of the academies.

- Carlos Insight: <failure></failure>

- bampot: the museum is made from a gigantic meteorite from the bottom of the lake. first it was a church, and then a city hall, and then a museum.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## the flowers - unearthed

- Tinton and Macpam and Bampot: we need a little bit more room than this. - they dig out the top of a bulb, the main bulb, and they each tie a string around it, and move back to form a triangle. "they tend to be big when they come out"

    - techniques -- shortening the rope by making loops and having them fall off. (is it the rope, or a spell? don't know)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- emerging from the ground: a giant turnip. 10 feet in diameter.

- the little roots at the end start squiggling around, and the goblins shout: "oh no it's one of these things!!"


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## the … fight?

- getting initiative.

- Heiro has been burping up fizzlecyst blood burps this whole time

- jean-luc is suffering montezuma's revenge from the exuviae's oil

- root that's formed a vaguely humanoid shape about 7 feet tall, snaking vine riders out towards you. tendrils? bine (twining vine) creepers.

- flick. hunter's mark.

- karbunqle: why are you attcking me in my home!

- hieronymus: throws broken bagpipes down at the ground; crouches down, summoning energy from the ground, and attacks. in order to perform stunning strike. - uses quarterstaff as a pole vault and vaults himself into the air. how does he enact a stunning strike?

    - the flippety-doo part of it? when H lands, he jabs the end of the staff down at one of the roots, like it's someone's toe.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- K: "what a zippedy doo strike!" and H. stuns it.

- H is so intimidated by the voice, that he turns and flees screaming.

- acrobats check: 12 nobody else even thinks about changing regarding how they feel about hieronymus

- reword this

- establish that quickling boots have to be repaired before they are worn

- fez has to use misty step to get the last 5 feet to attack; - hits with whip after affixing coral. and hits again.

    <!-- -->

- K: says that fez is a chip off the old block. looks so embarrassed that it can't speak hyper articulated way.

- hieronymus finds that bagpipes are also growing the tree

- K still can auto-regenerate some HP

- 'Thubudder is so big … that .. can you even lift … leave me alone……'

- fez quotes suntzu :

- [establish that paros is an adventuring scholar ??]

- K: the only reason it's red under me is because the flowers are bleeding now!

- practice not saying 'he says' but just doing the character

- flick gives mick shit for his whip doing no damage.

- K makes a plea to improve the powers of the whip if they stop attacking him. it's a green new deal!

- Fez: can we not fight him for a second.

- K and fez argue about whether puns or a sense of humor exist.

- Paros wants to see his Nude Eel (new deal). - K: i usually reserve that for my sexual partner, but OK.

    - [genital area in center of chest -- opens up into beautiful maioecis self-pollinating mafflegold flower)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick doubles over and vomits

- K: doesn't this humanize me at all to you. here i am in all my nakedness, yet you would still attack.

- Paros spends this turn not reading. - Paros starts experimenting with self-hard in form of shocking grasp. Readies shocking grasp as an action.

    - "if the potato acts aggressively"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav: what are these ? to goblins

- Bampot: they're called Bunkles. the poison is available as an inert vegetable root, but if it's allowed to grow this long around other nutrients, but they can be very testy if you wake them and try to cut peices of of their body.

- Drav: what if you just let them go back into the dirt

- Bunkle Jessie

- PRACTICE talking between bampot and Bunkle

- Bampot repeats KarbunQle at Flick a million times.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## out of combat and fezz gets a beefy whip

- Drav to K: can we just leave you alone

- K: that would be wonderful. - Don't mention Tinder around me! I don't know how the word Tinder came into my mind.

    - Flick: way to set up your own joke.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav to BP: is there a danger leaving it there?

- BP: if they get too big they release these sacks filled with spores. they are considered delicacies amongst Goblins but they require a great deal of care, so they are dangerous to other animals, and we try to recover them before they explore. it's a balancing act. we should probably have a better system. - this one matured faster than they usually do

    - Drav: can we ask them when they will mature?
    - BP: i'm not sure they have a great sense of chronology.
    - BP repeats carbunkle a million times. and starts drooling. i'm thinking of how delicious the spore sacks are.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- BP: if we get out of here, she'll retreat into the ground soon enough.

- Paros: well fez needs to whip it

- Drav: does that sound like a plan: we'll leave you alone if you promise to show Fez how to whip it great.

- K: i won't do technique. I usually come from the ground up.

- probably still should have had them make a charisma check or something

- sticks the whip in an enlarged eyespot on the top of its head -- now the whip is covered in thurny protrusions; thick rough vines with claws or thorns. - now a 2d4+1 whip, and the damage is slashing. but it's also magical. (so it's a +1 whip, 2d4 damage, magical)

    <!-- -->

- K: i've been able to put some of my sharper elements on it. they should last as long as you take care of it. requires a little tea tree oil. if you bury it in a forested area for 24 hours, it should heal


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## animate guardians of the forest

- fez: that's exactly what we need. and entmoot.

- they have faces but look kind of like bouncers (i had them do perception)

- Flick addresses: have we overstayed our welcome

- treant: we're just here to protect the karbunqle

- flick: lucky for us, we don't have any further pokey business with it.

- treant: so you're no longer a pokey man - you distance-stabbed the bunqle

    <!-- -->

- flick: i'm sorry about that.

- treant: you should be, as a ranger especially. why don't you honor the sanctity of the forests

- flick: in my defense, we did roll initiative - Bunqle has been generaous. and i' glad her healing capacity will undo the harm I did. and i'll be more careful.

    <!-- -->

- treant: that means a lot

- Paros: does she need help being replanted?

- treant: no, she's still essentially rooted right now.

- practice all three of these dopes talking together


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## asking about druids

- Flick: in elvish: we seek the druids who made the flying terror of the south. we seek a place of power where the child of the monster woman is stored.

- treant: i don't know the woman you speak of. i know there is a source of power there. the seomra crann used to be smaller.

- gotta speed up my delivery - in the last generation it's grown quickly -- there are a whole shitload of druids there, so maybe unnaturally.

    - at the same time, the dords grew into lake marka, and they were never there before. and what used to be a small lake became the alldrink in last hamme.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick: i need a drink after my last ham - what the fuck is the alldrink?

    - flick: where does it come from?

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- treants use their family to soak up water from the ground - the alldrink is part of the squee river watershed. other than that, i don't have an answer.

    - flick: i'm surprised you knew that much
    - treant: are you calling me a dunce?
    - should have had charisma check
    - treant: we're well schooled. disciples from Skimming come out here and lecture.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Did the bunqle not mention that you have to say its name everytime you use it?


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## general plans for the future

- Paros: what happened to things with the genii?

- Drav: our plan last time was to take care of the Peryton, then to Slubber and the FLowerfolk, and then the owl slavery - the ritual was performed here and had unexpected side effects

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## treant approaches hieronymus

- the threshold with you between the rational and irrational world is weaker

- H: as a general rule I don't lend it out to giant Peaches

- T: i'm a Beech tree.

- H is prejudiced against giant peaches.

- T: In case you were wondering the Bunkle's name is James. Together we are James and teh Giant Beech

- little leaves sprout from the quarterstaff. --

- T: i can tell that you attempt to get in touch with a deeper power residing within all of us. this staff will now respond to efforts of those kind which are particularly successful.

- H: that's wonderful, but I have some carbuncles on my feet from running away from battles.

- what battles is he running away from?

- T: do you have a container? [cloth sack] - H opens sack full of stuff

    - Beech tree takes two of its branches and pushes its stomach fat (paunch) into your bag, like cheese curds through cheesecloth.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- once the bag is full, H tilts his head back, and drinks thirstily by wringing out the cloth.

- T: oh boy, that's really gonna eliminate any kind of boundary you have maintained.

- H: I shake my head like someone coming in from a refreshing swim in the ocean.

- the oils lands on people -- soothing cosmetic treatment. all get 1 temp HP


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## what next -- off to see the druids

- H asks if they should try fighting the fiend again.
- flick: pretty sure we got rid of him.
- H: on…ward…?
- might need to ask precise directions from someone in t"the grimies" -- it's grihmies!"
- le grimies; el grimes

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## northwards (late morning of day 9)

- cross the kashte'a bridge and proceed north, hugging the shoreliness
- maybe first time they've seen economic activity (flick has seen "money" before!)
- people are merchants, farmers, craftspeople, traveling scholars, acolytes, … "soldiers"?
- [describing temples of xanthuc]
- [describe hamlet south of grihmies]

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## church

- church: gabled roof, a long nave ? straight, altar at the end, private rooms off to the side - no one standing out

    <!-- -->

- flick: "hello!"

- halfling runs out from one fo the back rooms. he's wearing a blue robe with red trim. "hello!"

- Hiero: (to fez) "this reminds me, can i borrow your whip?" - fez: yes, i do mind

    <!-- -->

- Hiero: aloud: are there any cat-o-nine-tails to self-flaggelate at this establishment. i seem to have forgotten my morning flagellations.

- Pandy: oh, perfect

- Hiero: yes, Mouse friend, if you could point me to the nearest

- Pandy: ??

- Hiero: didn't you say you were a Mouse Chef?

- Pandy looks around to see if the rest of the part reacts:

- Drav shrugs.

- Pandy. This is the COOLOTDF (COLDF) - it seems you already have some sort of alignment with the techniques that we profess

- Hiero: dismal is my favorite kind of future. could i trouble you to give me a few hearty blows on the back.

- Pandy: well i think we are aiming for the same effect but we have different methods

- Paros: He has a lot to atone for.

- Pandy: that's even better. as long as he's able to produce the necessary lachrymations

- Hiero: i can produce as many as you wish

- flick: but he's not pregnant! (i never got the talk)

- Heiro: opens robe and tries to start lactating.

- Pandy : onen moment! mandy, get out here! (prehends). come up with us to the altar

- flick hangs back

- Hiero: we don't have to be formal about it (twisting nipple very hard)

- Mandy: don't try that. it must come from the eyes.

- Hiero: i'm a hunble elf and can only cry tears

## tear extraction

- [both reach up to touch on temples]

- Con check 16 : hiero livingi the momentn when roxfallana turned into mule. though sort of accomodated self to it over the years; realized it was permanent effect, break into intense bouts of weeping, and tears begin flowin from your eyes. in their hands, they have vials to collect tears. - hiero: these are actually tears of happiness. Mandy notices. second glance: well this is more complex than i thought these emotions would be for you. is this giving you joy? how is this so?

    <!-- -->

- Hiero: this is the happiest day of my life.

- Mandy: It should be impossible for the lady to induce happiness when they've submitted themselves. are you not properly submitting yourself ?

- Hiero: Oh, I am! Oh, no, i'm sorry, i'm not. i hadn't realized i'd put up a defense.

- Mandy: pandy, dump that out, it's not what we want. this has been very confusing for us. you do seem an interesting specimen of study. would you consider spending time at the church while we look after you ?

- Flick to Jean-Luc: "never go with a halfling to a second occupation". he's outside pooping this disgusting orange diarrhea into the pristine lake

- Hiero: i'm afraid i must continue on with my friends. we are on an important quest

- Mandy: oh, has it caused any of you great sorrow?

- Flick: it's been one obscenities after another. - Mandy: that's quite a different reaction

    <!-- -->

- flick: shooting. -- Mandy: oh a lady quick to violence

## getting directions

- Mandy: we are at your informational service.

- Flick: we seek the druid circle.

- Mandy: they are just over the next ridge.

- Flick: have you had dealings with them? have they polymorphed or subjugated any of your citizens? come up with a bad solution to a pressing problem

- Mandy: our deities tend to avoid one another. the Lady is not … pain, but sadness. we don't like to inflict pain. but the druids their divine views aren't compatible with ours. as a church we are expanding, actually. we have temples in Cressida. and are looking to expand our influence in Yprosht

- Ian: did COLDF run the Parish school? flick erroneously remember they handed out ice cream cones at T-ball matches

- FLick: thanks for your help; we should probably be getting on.

- Pandy: yeah, Mandy, we can let them go. but before you do, you should make sure ot check out Bort's donut cart. - your son is named Bort ?! what are these simpsons?!

    - oh, i remember now, Son of Simp. the Simp Sons.

## bort's donut cart

- want some donuts? you don't need a pitch when the donuts are this good.

- Drav makes check to see if … what the sugar is. doesn't seem poisonous. not using sugary tears of sadness - flick gives a sniff. not a lot of experience with baked goods. [24] smells like Zarachiel. the sap angel.

    <!-- -->

- Paros: I thought he smelled good!

- [complex ecology for sap and the zorbon]

- [it is real sugar, but it's also mystical. plain sugar DOES exist -- this is like the eucarist after it's been blessed. it's a transubstantiated medium]

- Flick to bort: that's a very complex bouquet. how do you spice these?

- Bort: that's a proprietary secret.

- Hiero: are these cakey or flakey donuts? - Bort: dense as the day is long

    - Hiero: so like cake?
    - Bort: wait, what do you mean by a flakey donut?
    - Hiero: when it's light, airy, and puffy inside
    - Bort: like it has a lot of thin dough layers to it ? no, not like that
    - Hiero: are they soldier donuts, or monk donuts … ?
    - Bort: this is another vendor -- Krog -- we're not friends. he took my donut idea . he used to call them Krog donuts, but now it's just Kronuts. we usually proceed counter-clockwise, or one goes widdershins and the other goes diusil (dussel-bort) -- so about now he's probably in Goad mess. … we're both going south. we cross twice per rotation of the lake.

    <!-- -->

- Ian: really getting into the corners of this world

- Hiero: where could a fellow findi a nice glass of poison and bed of nails to sleep on around here?

- Bort: they have exactly what you're looking for on the Grihmies.

- Flick: is there a monastery of the order of the batshit bagpipes on the Grihmies ?

- Bort: definitely a monastery of some sort. - some of the smaller isles are just cults.

    <!-- -->

- Flick: lotta cults in this area

- Bort: i say cult, but it's really just people that others don't understand. - you gonna get any donuts or what?

    <!-- -->

- flick to paros: this smells like Z - P: yeah, he smelled good!

    <!-- -->

- (one silver for 12 donuts) -- Paros eats 12 goodberries, basically. if paros even looks at Jean-Luc, he will blow everything out of his body (in solidarity) -- or not-so-solidarity.

- Bort: no, these will constipate the hell out of you. you'll be lucky to take a shit in the next year. - Bort: they're just tasty donuts, i don't know how they affect you.

    <!-- -->

- Carlos buys 12, shoves into satchel. (these don't expire after 24 hours)
