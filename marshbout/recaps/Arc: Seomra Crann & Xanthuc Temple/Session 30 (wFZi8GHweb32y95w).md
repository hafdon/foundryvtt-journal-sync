# Transcript

<div>Flick and Jean-Luc drop into the room. Flick continues towards the rest of the group on the far side near the remaining rubble. Jean-Luc sees a regular wooden door which looks out of place in this stone tunnel. As he inspects it, he can see light coming from underneath. [wis 4] Intrigued, the plausibly dashing rogue incautiously shoulders open the thick door and walks in. Since fleeing from Kriopolis after "getting involved with the wrong woman" and, more recently, being adopted by a rag-tag collection of Goop Snoopers, this little bit of apparent city life calls out to Jean-Luc warmly. Inside, a small dive bar greets him, empty of occupants except for a single beautiful woman profiled against the ambient light, nursing a beer. She sports close-cropped dark-green hair, a tiny nose that looks slightly broken and wears a well-fitting doublet and trousers set off by a bright white fizzlesilk ascot tied loosely about her neck. [insight 12] He knows her instantly: Marjorie. The honeypot. He'd bought drinks for her all night at The Shady Sill until, upon going to pay, discovered his purse has been sliced and the contents removed by, presumably, thieves. Calling out the bartender for providing an unsafe drinking environment had gotten him nowhere. Marjorie had offered to settle everything, but instead somehow indebted him to the Gaol Maidens, a crime ring centered on Kriopolis but with cells all over Albland.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Seeing her here is a relief, although admittedly a freak chance, after bivouacking through the wilderness for days and receiving skin treatments even more dubious than ones he'd had to pass off on unsuspecting tourists (he'd started pretty low on the career ladder with the Maidens). This slice of familiarity feels just right.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Out of the corner of her ear, Flick, hearing Jean-Luc's footfalls turn off to the right, glances back to see the open door and a mildly sickening greenish-yellow light spilling from the room. A "Hey, friend, you alright?" gives Jean-Luc a slight pause as to the advisability of this detour, but he successfully compartmentalizes the warning and approaches Marjorie.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: Oh Jean-Luc, I also never thought I'd see you again.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: If I recall correctly, I believe you owe me a drink</div>

<div>Marjorie: How do you figure?</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: Well the last drink was on me and it ended up costing me my entire money purse.</div>

<div>Marjorie: I thought we'd discovered that was a rowdy bar patron who'd taken advantage of you. (She winks)</div>

<div>Jean-Luc laughs: I suppose we should let bygones be bygones. A round, barkeep!</div>

<div>Marjorie: I think you've already got one.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc looks down to see that, indeed, a beer is waiting for him on the counter. Meanwhile, Flick, weirded out, gets into a squat, grunts, and bears down: a sign to the others that she's casting her 'horizonal gaze' towards potential fiends or monstrosities within five miles. But she doesn't sense any nearby. Jean-Luc [nature 20], confident that the beer is beer, gulps down a thiccc slice.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: I've been wondering why I never saw you again after you joined the group. I was hoping you'd come back and rescue me.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: I wanted to come back, but I had a falling out with the Maidens. I really did mean to. It got dangerous.</div>

<div>Marjorie: Things were dangerous for me as well. (She removes the white scarf from her neck, which is slit open to the spine.) I wish that you'd been able to protect me from him! (She points to the back corner, where a thuggish man awaits.) That trick I played on you didn't always go over as well; one time he did get violent before I could bring him back to the crew.</div>

<div>Marcus: Is this one of the guys that tried to rip me off?</div>

<div></div>

<div>Meanwhile, still out in the larger room, Flick's pants fall down as, forgetting to cinch her belt cord after using it to illustrate a particularly sophisticated and boring concept pertaining to the quasi-geometric topology of planar travel [initiative 6] she tries to nod to Carlos that something's up in the 'bar' and, having tied her belt cord to the bowstring in her frantic haste, almost snaps her bow.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc, with grief, anger, and the general sense that something's not right here, charges Marcus. Marcus, exemplifying for Jean-Luc all the evils of urbanity, and swirling with a constellation of reminders of that criminally fraught life, goes dagger-to-Lydia (Jean-Luc's sword) and sustains a confident swipe to the arm.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marcus: We're all just the same to you, aren't we? Someone to take advantage of? Well, I'll show you how unique I am. (Reaching behind his head, he rips his face. Off. The skin, which was healthy, peels away to reveal grey and white rotting flesh suppurating with grey pus and rippling with maggots.)</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: Well, this is par for the course, though gross.</div>

<div>Marcus: I didn't say I was gross, I said I was unique. Why, what are you seeing?</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: Just another nightmare I'll need to drink away.</div>

<div>Marcus: I wouldn't trust the beer here. Your bartenders put sleeping potions in it sometimes.</div>

<div></div>

<div>For just a moment Jean-Luc is overtaken by fear: his very organs tremble at the idea that this creature is getting closer. Somehow the presence of Marjorie gives him courage, or bravado, it's hard for him to know. Fittingly, Marcus runs behind the bar and attempts to hide.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez, stepping light in his Hedge-approved footwear, scurries into the bar and, from his privileged tiny tiny angle very close to the ground, sees the putrid reflection of Marcus in the lacquered and well-polished walls. He strides confidently up to the bar, climbs laboriously onto a barstool (smiling confidently all the while), and whips to either side of the zombielike creature to keep him petrified in place.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marcus: Ah, this crew is using whips now? How fancypants.</div>

<div>Fez: I'm always looking for a new enemy to face.</div>

<div>Marcus: I see what you did. But it seems a bit annoying if you're just an outsider who comes in to kill "new" people.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus [int 16], taking a moment to orient himself to the secret resonances of the Whispering Walls, wheezes into a nearby stone, "Fellas, fellas, let's ... let's not fight. Can't you see this ghost is tearing us apart. I feel like this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship if we drop our arms and bring it in for a nice hug."</div>

<div>Marjorie: Which ghost is he talking about?</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus [performance 6] sprints up behind Marjorie, shouts "You! You're the ghost!" and then gently holds his hands up beside her face, delivers "Fellas fellas stop fighting. It's not worth it" in an unconvincing falsetto. Marcus asks, "Is that really the pitch of your voice?" Not to be dissuaded, Hieronymus continues, "Jean-Luc, if you agree to put down your weapon and not fight anymore I'll give you a nice smoooooch!" Jean-Luc, utterly baffled by this conflicting evidence, freezes out of indecisiveness. At the same time a shout is heard from the sub-basement.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Rotrude: Hieronymus, are you attempting to mess with someone's head, as you messed with mine, in pushing it under the lake?</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Begone, vile creature!</div>

<div>Rotrude: Yes, that is very familiar to what you said to me last time.</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Uh, no, we ended on good terms.</div>

<div>Rotrude: Do you mean 10 seconds ago, when I was turned, or 10 minutes ago, when I emerged wet and sopping from the lake?</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Every time we've seen each other our interactions have been great. So there's no need to bring up the past.</div>

<div>Rotrude: Once I get up there, I will dispute with you as is our custom in the monastery.</div>

<div>Flick: Is this the one you killed?</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Welllllll, she thinks I did.</div>

<div>Flick: So you're the top line on the shitty monastery people list.</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Pretty much everybody from my monastery was shitty.</div>

<div>Rotrude: Yes, I remember Germ√∂trid used to sit on the frogs to indicate how much weight she was gaining, and she would measure it by the number of frogs she could kill merely by squatting on them.</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Yes, I actually liked her. She was one of the good ones. And we had delicious frog dinners in those days.</div>

<div>Rotrude: What else did you like about her?</div>

<div>Hieronymus: She was cool because she didn't go around drowning and blaming me for it. That's something that I really dislike in a person.</div>

<div>Rotrude: It's ironic because you would often comment on how you loved it when the bottom of the monk's cassocks would become wettened, and you could see it stick to their spindly little legs.</div>

<div>Hieronymus: Yes, who doesn't like that?</div>

<div>Rotrude: You said it reminded you of your parents when they went wading for clams or mussels.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Heironymus, shouting "Oh Nooooooooo!" makes to leave the room to search for Rotrude.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Carlos glances over at Amalia shadow-boxing with a potential adversary and, grumbling "Go go hammer," covers the undead dwarf with the spiritual hammer and makes his way into the bar, nudging the unconscious Drav to rouse her. Rotrude, hearing 'Bruce' spoken from above, asks, "Did someone mention Bruce? You should ask Hieronymus about a Bruce."</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez: I don't think anyone wants to poke that bear.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: Jean-Luc, why are you letting this strange-smelling, inappropriately hairy monk manipulate me like this? (and in so doing casts Vengeful Glare)</div>

<div></div>

<div>At first, Jean-Luc feels terrified, but then remembers that she was one of the first people who tricked him, and reconsiders their entire relationship history in this context. In the other room, Amalia remains hunched up in the corner. Flick, having recovered herself after tripping on a loose stone spur, smirks towards Jean-Luc and asks if he needs any help. Jean-Luc, visibly reeling, welcomes with a nod this offer of assistance.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marcus: You sure keep a varied crew, don't you. I was expecting a bunch of rabscrabble humans, but this is quite unusual.</div>

<div>Flick: Rabscrabble?</div>

<div>Marcus: Yeah, that's a word in Kriobolis.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick, able to focus on the slash in Marjorie's neck, sends a javelin of force energy into the woman.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: Clearly my accusatory gaze isn't enough for you, Jean-Luc. When you abandoned me before, it caused my death: how can you not defend me now that I'm back?</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: I assumed that you would be able to take care of yourself. (Though he's heard of revenants before, Marjorie appears to have a different agenda than most revenants. Nevertheless, feelings of guilt persist for him.) Put her down, Hieronymus!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc runs over to the bar, parkours against Hieronymus's face and a barstool, does a front-tuck and comes down with Lydia into Marcus, dinking him slightly as Marcus defends himself with his dagger. Jean-Luc, shouting "I guess I should attack this guy. Don't worry, I won't fail you this time!" gets begrudging respect from the gruff-speaking throat-slitter for his gymnastic performance.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marcus: I _thought_ you scumbags were working together. I do seem to have painted myself into a corner here, though. I've bet you've never done a good thing in your life.</div>

<div>Flick: Our plans may not have the results we want, but we're not evil.</div>

<div>Marcus: You certainly look like a group that has a _plan_ well in hand. I've walked twelve dogs simultaneously with more of a plan.</div>

<div>Marjorie: Finally, a real rescue attempt!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav awakens to find her friends running into this newly apparent pub; rushing up and into the room she's confronted with the rotting visage of Marcus across the bar and a strange woman with her throat slit and pointed towards Jean-Luc. Fez again rainbows his whip over the bar, slashing at the until recently unbuttoned sea-abyss-boiled leather armor of Marcus. Hieronymus, still wobbly from Jean-Luc's padded kick to his face, crawls, weeping shamefacedly, around the far end of the bar. "I can't believe my best friend would be so careless as to kick me in the face."</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc: There is no possible world in which I am your best friend. What about that mule you keep fucking?</div>

<div>Hieronymus: She's more of a confidant.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus attacks from the ground with his quarterstaff, making his way up the zomboid's body with each strike, finally landing one in the groin that doubles him over. He then forgoes an unarmed strike in order to attempt a jig on the bar, but slips on putrid flesh and falls back on his butt. His foot brushes up gently against Marcus's face, reminding him for a moment of Rotrude's post-drowning face.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marcus: You're not as good on your feet as this buttoned-up dandy next to me.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus is reminded of the briny marsh area near the lake where he used to go with Roxfallanah to reminisce about his odiferous family. He would cover his beloved mule with stinky mud and bring her back to the monastery to annoy everyone; like a cow, once brought up the stairs she couldn't go back down. She would remain where she was until a barn elevator was built to bring her down.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Carlos, casting his eye on the two undead, for some reason doesn't believe Marjorie to be susceptible to Turn Undead. He calls down Sacred Flame on Marcus. Drav causes the far end of the bar to explode in shrapnel; Jean-Luc, still seeking to prove his worth, pulls a drink tray from under the bar and flips it in front of Marjorie's face, but it passes her too early to provide any cover.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie crawls across the bar to take out her rage on Jean-Luc. She smashes him with one of her calloused and workpersonlike fists. "Taking my fate in my own ... HANDS ... energizes me," and she appears to heal the hole in her throat. Flick takes a cue from this fist and launches one of her own, as force, at Marcus, who shakes his head, "Almost an honorable fistfight!" The next arrow, a wooden one, reams a substantial hole in the zomboid's head as he collapses into a greenish salivary puddle. Marjorie and Flick have a dispute regarding their relationship to Jean-Luc.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-Luc finally realizes that, no matter what "Marjorie" may be, it's not the historical and sociopersonal figure he's familiar with; no doubt feeling bad about it, he attacks her.</div>

<div>Marjorie: I knew you'd come after me brutally like this.</div>

<div>Jean-Luc: YOU'RE NOT MARJORIE!</div>

<div>Marjorie: You wish to take away my identity as well? ...I suppose this is a bit my fault. I've let myself get trapped by three feisty incels. I still think you should back off tho.</div>

<div></div>

<div>As a gesture of goodwill (?) Hieronymus produces from his satchel a few flat round stones and massage oil, scooping some of Marcus's gluids into the ointment (a magical secretion of Roxfallanah's anal sacs) and rubs into Jean-Lucs shoulders the healing unguent. "I hope that you'll remember this when the time comes to repay the favor," moans Hieronymous cringingly. Jean-Luc shudders to himself at the thought of what that might entail. Marjorie blasts Jean-Luc with an accusation of selfishness for keeping to himself the renewed vigor, at which Jean-Luc, really leaning into the incel thing, screams at her to shut up.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus: I would have attacked her but I'm afraid of her banter.</div>

<div>Rotrude (from the floor below): I did always love our banter, and I do not know why you're being self-deprecating right now.</div>

<div>Hieronymus: I'm going to banter you in the face!</div>

<div>Rotrude: See, I love this.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav, shooting a firebolt, misses, being distracted by the sight of a small child crouching under the table to her right. Edging behind Carlos, Drav makes eye-contact with the child and motions towards Marjorie. "Is this bad woman trying to hurt you?"</div>

<div></div>

<div>"Drav, is that you? What are you doing up there? You're going to get hurt!" Drav suddenly has a vague memory of this child: with her elf parents, she had to hide from them this part of her life. She had an imaginary friend that she knew she wasn't supposed to tell anyone about. It seems as though they've returned to her. Her name was Eldar, and Drav would get into scrapes exploring the woods, or sneaking into her parents' library to read books she wasn't supposed to. Eldar, though, looks frightened. [investigation 9] The table's shadow is obscuring her physiognomy too much to determine how 'alive' she is.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav crawls closer to the figure under the table, who whispers, "We were just here a few moments ago. You stood up and started throwing all sorts of terrifying magic around."</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav: I was just under _here_?</div>

<div>Eldar: Yeah, we were just under here playing.</div>

<div>Drav: Have I grown up?</div>

<div>Eldar: You've always changed a little differently than I have. I can still see that you're Drav; it doesn't matter that you look like an older dwarf now.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav moves close enough to touch the child; Carlos attempts to pull Drav backwards, but Drav slips out of his hands and makes it fully under the table. [insight 12] However real Drav knew that Eldar was when they were children, she seems to be more so now, despite being somewhat translucent. It seems enough unlike the "undead goop monsters" to stay close.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Eldar: I think we can sneak out the door and go exploring again!</div>

<div>Drav: Yes, let's be very quiet and play hide-and-seek, and keep an eye out.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Eldar, whispering "I think we should play tag instead," reaches out to touch Drav; where the wizard is touched, the flesh begins to wither away. Drav scrambles backwards as Eldar teases "You're it!" and bolts through the solid stone wall. Given the opportunity, Drav quickly scans the undersides of the other tables in the bar; seeing nothing, she stands up, only to notice a large glass jar containing loosely packed black soil on top of the table she was just tunder. [arcana 18] She hears a voice in her head: "Tell Flick that the Shoemaker is here." Drav conveys the message to Flick, who recalls that Onfalon had spoken of a 'protector of the forest' Shoemaker Byte, rumored to be a spiritualist who kept spiritual entities in the basement of their creepy mansion; people would come to supplicate themselves and act as vessels for the spirits who would enter and provide drug-like experiences.</div>

<div></div>

<div>"I told you this was a trap!" Carlos intones, casting healing word. "There's dirty dirty undeads everywhere!" "I should have listened to you, my wise elder," Drav responds. "But Drav what's wrong with a little dirty now and then?" Eldar shouts from her invisible location. Carlos, an imposing force for good, continues harboring her religious potential.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: You're slimy in your fighting as well as your life. Let me get a good punch in on you! --And you just see me as a meat puppet, do you? I like to make relationships with people, even the ones I'm going to rip off.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick unleashes another volley, gives a slightly paranoid glance to the table under which the child appeared, and asks Drav, "Is that someone you know?"</div>

<div>Drav: It took the form of an imaginary friend I had in my youth, but it never did that.</div>

<div>Flick: I should hope not.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Behind Drav, Flick sees a huge hulking figure step through the door: a bear twice the height of a human: Shoemaker Byte! She wears an iron kettle upside-down on her head and holds out a double-pawful of goodberries. "Did you think these were coming out of thin air?" [wis 6] Flick all of a sudden perceives the innate flammability of the wood in the bar, finding herself overtaken by the urge to make sure none of it sets on fire. The bear walks to the table next to Drav and smashes into the piece of furniture with a massive woodcutter's axe, shouting, "this is all kindling! Make sure you get rid of it!" and pushes Flick towards another one of the tables.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: What regrets do you have about me? I have regrets: That I ever knew you; that I got in with this crew; that I went after Marcus.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez tries to whip off her head, as Hieronymus whips himself into a clunky pirouette, punching and swinging during the apogee of his revolutions until his last blow lands.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Marjorie: That's a lot of sound and fury.</div>

<div>Hieronymus: I might give it another whirl.</div>

<div>Rotrude: Don't let him whirl you! It's another name for a swirly!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Carlos tries to Command Eldar, who, unaffected, giggles and runs further down the stairs. Inside the bar, Shoemaker is carrying the jar of soil. Drav launches a bolt of fire from her hands, igniting Marjorie's scarf and singeing some of her undead pluripotent stem cells. She tries to bring down Jean-Luc as a metonym for the crime syndicate. Flick, staring daggers at Drav for setting something aflame, takes a dampened misty step, fires a slug at Drav (who gets knocked prone), puts a mortal arrow through Marjorie ("Jean-Luc, once again you leave me mur-dered!" Heironymus claps him on the back, "You sure know how to pick 'em, buddy". Rotrude shouts, "You sure had your share of pathetic girlfriends in your day as well. And you never wanted me to tell anyone, but that time you cheated on Roxfallanah." Hieronymus responds, "Hey, why don't you try being Rote-nice for once, instead of Rote-rude." to which she says, "I would have said Rote-kind "), and pushes a table slightly closer to an outside wall of the bar, away from Drav. After this, Flick drops to the ground and rolls around to extinguish any possible flames on her person.&nbsp;</div>
