## starting recording

### Carlos sees the mule going through spirit puberty

- we start with Hiero perception

- what Carlos is looking for -- keeping an eye on the situation

- Carlos takes the opportunity to get in touch with Aulé / Dogdo

- Hieronymous [perception 18] - mule has 1 more eye. and growing something out of its forehead (eye coming out of left temple) - my roxthalanna finally coming into puberty, and becoming the woman i've always wanted her to be. perhaps we should throw her a coming of age party?

    <!-- -->

- Paros: if the mule is having a quincenera, i want to make a pinata

- DM: paros, you're very appealing right now. maybe the glazed look that a lot of the druids seem to have. when you stop in front of Lanhareth they almost wave Battlepick aside.

- Paros: yeah, that guy should chill out. how are people doing back at the gnome village. are they doing ok in school?

- Lanhareth: who are you?

- P: my names paros; I had the pleasure of visiting Briangle, and i was wondering if you had any news from our friends over there.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### catching up with Lanhareth

- Lanhareth: you were also there! (Drav, Flick, Paros, Fez, Carlos?) - dot dot, slash and hypen are doing well

    - i don't know briffa and reginald

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: someday i will introduce them to you. they're some great gnomes. what brings you out here?

- Lanhareth: just contacting some old friends.

- Paros: a hell of a shrub you have here

- L: not mine. primarily taken care of by the druids.

- P: whatever they're doing, it's working

- L: i suppose you could say that. it's certainly a thriving … shrub. not to my taste, i prefer the serene enclosure of a chemical laboratory.

- P: oh yeah i guess that makes sense. any tips on avoiding getting struck by bird poop?


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### making the holy shit

- Carlos gets in touch with Aulé. vibe is metallic and removed from the earth.
- i meant: distanced, separated,
- brief vision of intense life-energy coming from the top of the hedge, where the densest mass of birds would be.
- carlos: "so my god, you're with the birds?"
- paros: carlos's god is "for the birds" [under his breath]
- Carlos: wow, fighting words!
- drav: paros doesn't say anything under his breath
- (jean-luc): battlepick has arms crossed defensively. "this damn elf"
- JL: "mercenary work, huh"
- BP: what does somebody soft like you know about mercenary work
- JL: don't let the clothes fool you. i've worked with some uppity elves
- H: uppity?!
- Flick: yeah we can say that about ourselves, but you're not allowed to say that
- JL: I stand by it
- Lan: it looks like all three of us are elves. glory be!

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### Lan on fizzlecane

- Flick (this guy is high as balls) - [nat 20 insight] L is high on own supply. you remember them complaining about Ymenetra, and how she made bad jokes, so get the impression that L likes being own boss, and likes being in the company of elves

    <!-- -->

- H: wander over to the base of the hedge with vial of bird shit, "let's just see here, if i remember my lessons correctly" . and pour a few drops onto an outgrowth of the hedge. trying to fertilize a small patch out it.

- walk by the two martial artists; stop fighting and watch intently - should have done something with this

    - H notices that leaves are dripping with the bird shit

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Carlos: you did not get the "this is an abomination" feeling. it's an extremely intense concentration f world energy. - <s>it doesn't&nbsp;not&nbsp;extend to the poop</s>

    (this contradicts what i later say, so ignore it)

    - retroactive smell of poop: just smelled chalky. takes a chipping of poop and mixes with holy water.
    - as mix it with bottle of holy water, turns into bright shining swirling liquid almost like microwaved syrup or the golden lion syrup. scintillating. feels like a little rivulet that runs off the massive ball of life energy. it just has the viscosity of syrup. it smells like freshly cut grass. Carlos tastes it. [20 wisdom]
    - Carlos tastes the liquid (wants to keep it incase it's useful). in front of you is Hiero's mule. you can see that the eye that emerged from its head is one of 6 total; 3 under the skin. glowing golden silhouettes of potential eyes. 8 more mouths layered impossibly one on top of the other. and an inset horn, like a ram's horn, set within its head, in potentia.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Carlos: This mule is an abomination!

- H: how dare you! she's only mutating that was so she can chew us an entrance into this giant hedge. - good roxalanna. good girl

    <!-- -->

- P: yeah it's going through mule puberty. don't shame her.

- Flick: aren't mules sterile?

- P: at some point the mule is going to be old enough that someone is going to play "pin the tail on the mule"

- H: in human years she's 13 years old. when she was transformed. and since then 20 years have elapsed.

- Drav: I thought the mule was your wife.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### a betrothal story

- H: Yes, indeed we are betrothed.

- flick: your wife's just now going through puberty

- H: it seems that now she is

- Drav: did you get married before or after ?

- H: we were married after she was transformed. i had known her briefly before. and to be honest, we didn't get along, until she took on her present and true form (i would say)

- Paros: I heard you had a beautiful ceremony

- H: yes it was lovely. we had the finest band in all elfdom. they played all our old favorites on the lute.

- Drav: [i'm just going to ignore all of that]

- Lanhareth turns to flick: "you're sure Hieronymus is an elf?" - flick (in elvish): i have no reason to doubt it

    - Lan: he looks more like my little mercenary friend here. so short and ugly. i though all elves were beautiful.
    - [oh, apparently Hiero is 5 feet tall, so not that short]

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick: what a pleasure to see you here away from that overbearing boss of yours, having struck out on your own. - Lan: more like "hit a grand slam on my own"

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### diving deeper with Lanhareth's cover story

<pre>- "oh, you know Denny , that halfling who has a delicious little breakfast stand outside of Goad Mess"
</pre>

- H: I have some pancakes that he made. (pulls out moldy pancakes). and perhaps we can pour some of that syrup on these.

- Lan: none for me, dear boy, i don't have quite the appetite right now.

- Flick: there are particulates in fizzlecyst blood, you can extract crystals and crush them and snort them up. - how does his nose look to me? (fizzlecane)

    - flick [nat 1]: convinced that when lan opens his mouth, it's full of reddish crystally, flaky substance - immediately overwhelmed with condescending concern. (thinks L taking to drinking it without purifying it in any way)

        <!-- -->

    - carlos [good role]: just a hunt by his nostril of red crystal, and nothing by the mouth (like they are snorting it)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick: what are you doing to yourself, buddy?

- L: oh the walk from Briangle? oh, that's nothing. battlepick hates me for sure, but nothing i couldn't handle.

- Flick: i still haven't heard … we're here to see the druids too. what brings you here? - L: just visiting family and friends. -F: do you know anyone in the circle?

    - L: oh yes, that's my cousin … frazzle…el. Frazzle'el -- oh, it looks like she's not paying attention. i think i'm some kind of uncle of hers. (person might not even be an elf - he might have picked the most well disguised person to wave to)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### p.s.a

- Flick to Lan: tincture of silver elm suspended in alcohol, is a good remedy for fizzlecane withdrawal or overdose
- LH: if anyone is a drug user here, it's Battlepick
- H: hey you want to pick your battles, man
- L: (to Battlepick): don't say anything too nasty about me, even though it's against your natural inclinations.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### flick wants to contact the hierophant

- flick: i guess i want to contact the nature … police. whoever transformed a fey creature into something even worse.

- [history check to determine internal political structure]

- L: your best bet is with one of the sioromans / shee-row-mans -- they are sort of like glorified palmists. there's Eth Eliothai (a distant relation of mine -- if you mention my name in full, they'll be sure to take you in. the inside is welcoming but can be difficult to find yourself around) -- sounds legit according to history check - they don't have to worry about efficacy, so they can engage in stuff like palmistry

    <!-- -->

- this actually is getting things backward

- F to L: take that tincture

- L: well, it sounds like too much of a depressant. i prefer a nice stimulant. - F: well, all the best to you

    - L: you as well!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- JL: talking to Battlepick. "what does this guy having you running around for?

- BP: sounds like he's trying to establish some sort of drug connection here. as far as i can tell that's all it is. - exchange Kel'sovh salutes (mountain salute) -- they hail their brothers and sisters in arms. - it wouldn't be offensive; it might be confusing.

    ```
    <!-- -->
    ```

    <!-- -->

- JL reports this

- the two philosophers are still there.

- Drav

- Aphelia, like i'm a-feelin' ya - she was given to these druids after she was created

    <!-- -->

- Paros wants to know about the pescaculture / return to the lake of the ghost fish - asking Lan: "i've spent almost all the four days since then without sleep in my lab; i wouldn't be able to tell you if fisher-people had repopulated the lake. i never heard anything bad, but i didn't talk to gnomes while i was preparing to visit family.'

    - i found myself not ordering in very much. it's a wonderful feeling. i've never felt better in my life.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: Congratulations. - L: congratulations to you!

    <!-- -->

- P: I think he seems like a nice guy.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### drav and the philosophers

- [D recognizes the two philosophers from the fresco.] - cozies over and observs from nearby.

    - can get close; they look engaged in conversation. "The changespace". arguing about whether or not the events in the CS are stable throughout all time, or if they are changed by its manifestation in the material world.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- need timeline for peryton / Aphelia -> see faction card for start on this

- [D; is it a physical space in the hedge?]

- [me: underlies reality, like it's a secondary plane of energy; talking about it in relation to the hedge]

- Lovesea: Seomra wouldn't even be possible at this level of growth if the changespace were stable. it must respond to actual events

- Phil2: No, these sorts of things can come from outside; weird places; the CS doesn't have to be dynamic

- ask for more checks ? - [me: you don't know specifics with the hedge; but when you were researching the … 4 points text … they set out those four points - relative to the material plane, but stable with respect to the changespace, almost like a five-dimensional representation of the 4 dimensions of spacetime. so the energy points can be depicted stablely in changespace but not in regular space.

    <!-- -->

- name these four points

- two elves / half-elves; the one is looking at you, says "i think we have a … visitor here? can i help you"

- hellos exchanged. my name is drav. lost? no.

- D: couldn't help overhearing your fascinating conversation

- Oh! rare to find people who takes an interest outside of purview.

- D: all branches of magic have their own (eccentricity/)

- Lovesea: particular branch?

- D: i specialize in evocation, but i've read about many others.

- Lovesea: many say that evocation is the most fundamental of the classic magic schools. have you found that to be so?

- D: sure… ?

- Lovesea: no need to commit. what did you find interesting about the conversation.

- D: discussing whether … magic of the moment .. hedge.

- stop with the bad puns that all characters make

- Lovesea: it's a topic that fascinates both of us. My name is Lovesea. - and this is Lafarelle

    <!-- -->

- [ flick hears 'stable space' or 'portal' and comes over]

- D: you mentioned something about an event

- Lafarelle explains the 4 points around the ritual to banish Tantegorisch - in order to study something in a practical sense you need a strong theoretical foundation, and hope to make that available to the fieldworkers

    <!-- -->

- Flick: you have fieldworkers? what are they doing in the field regarding T.

- Lovesea: Nothing about T. but the aftermath of our own doings, in order to get rid of him.

- Flick: Do you know Lupenna? - Lovesea: kind of. you might need to ask someone who's been out of the hedge a little longer.

    - Flick: where can I find something like that. it must be strange that a random elf is interested in T. i have my reasons.
    - Lovesea: as i've just told drav, people have their own intersts. i wouldn't be surprised if you came up asking about anything.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- [drav: they seem more academic than the last druids we met]


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### jean-luc asks about other drug dealers

- [jean-luc: is being on these drugs illegal? if so, it means there's a smuggler or drug dealer]

- should i have introduced this, but for a different subplot

- [dm: you don't know why lanhareth was so sketchy. maybe he'll lose academic funding? - also, the mountain group is almost X because they are militant.

    - no overarching police structure
    - ooh, maybe mountain group does do some other crazy drug.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### hieronymus asks about a map

- Hieronymous: is anyone selling maps we can use to navigate the hedge
- Lafarelle: we love the hedge because it changes every day ; it's perfect as a controlled experiment for us to examine the changespace. no map could be made without recourse to something stable like that. you wouldn't be able to read it, even if it had been drawn up, which it hasn't.
- Lafarelle: there's as fascinating little trick it has to grow little arrow-shaped flowers to point you in the right direction.
- Lafarelle says:

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<pre>10 years ago
- Seomra Crann started "coming into its own" - increase in growth, the ability to grow flowers to point people in the right direction, create staircases 
</pre>

- that's what we were arguing about when you came up!
- Drav: do you perform a lot of rituals within Seomra
- Lovesea: we try not to unless we understand what's going on. There are druids that do do rituals, but it's with Seomra's consert, and that muddies the waters about where the energy is coming from

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### where to go next; details about Seomra

- Drav: do you know anyone with practical experience with these rituals, and what the results were

- Lovesea: Beluar (one of the organizers)

- Lafarella: and a Kendu'el

- Lovesea: you're too kind to laugh at my poor attempt at a pun

- Paros: [details on how to get the tree to respond] - if i want to go to the bathroom …. ?

    <!-- -->

- Lafarelle: it'll just kind of make the bathroom for you.

- Paros: do people get lost inside? - Lafarelle: we might not know about it? i never see skeletons appear. who's to say it's not eating those bones entirely.

    <!-- -->

- Paros: at least if it's eating people, it's using all the parts

- Lovesea: don't listen to him. if someone gets lost, Seomra can open up an easy path, provide them food, water, and shelter. - it might do it to an evil presence

    <!-- -->

- Larefarelle vs. Lovesea: see, you do believe!


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### into Seomra?

- as you cross the threshold it's no longer dark inside; looks a little like just before twilight. - Paros asks for darkness like night. (a big flower just comes and covers Paros's face

    <!-- -->

- Flick: I seek Aphelia, the embodiment of Calliope's "music" (little does flick know that \_yth\_ in Succuban is both 'kiss' and 'music')

- inside: people milling about. large inside. 20 - 30 feet up, it looks like it becomes a mass of hedge . some climbing staircases, or hoisted by vines. a little spiral staircase opens up next to you. lined with very large buttercup flowers the size of a beer barrel lid. - it's not a maze, partly because it's being created continuously.

    <!-- -->

- Paros: "i seek a delcious snack!" - flower pulls away from him; eyes look like tobolux's eyes: flower petals pouring out of his eyes; and eyeballs painted on the outside of his eyelids. "that doesn't sound like a snack!" -- one of buttercup flowers tilts out into his mouth: drinking the most delicious butter'd milk shake. tastes like vanilla smells. Paros: "i am not worried about my eyes"

- Hieronymus: i'd like to be slightly asphyxiated.

- Flick: sotto voce and fey: oh how could i forget H is such a pervert - (apropos of nothing): not all beautiful and magically tinged creatures are the same, Drav

    <!-- -->

- tree shoots a nut into H's throat, and it's very hard for him to breath. H: "this … perfect … order … one … jean-luc"

- DK: galen stop fucking with my character - vine comes out and drops one delicately in JL's hand.

    <!-- -->

- Paros: resin dissolves and can see naturally, but has eyes on outside of eyelids. the paint smells like the bird shit.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### up the "stairs"

- move pretty fast, or seems like it.

- with the vines … and the stalks

- deposited in a room that's being used for music. there are woodwind instruments, string instruments, there's a harp.

- Paros: flick when you asked for the music of Calliope, what was that about?

- Flick: Aphelia isn't a naturally born person. she's the humanoid crystallization of the musical power of this fey creature that turned into the Peryton. the oil hierophant, -- we're here to de-perytonize this fey creature - makes sense to Flick on a level she can't quite articulate. "periodic vibrations"

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### the music room:

- a few young women with instruments

- H: one just playing a bagpipe. one has a lute, tiny drum, mini viola

- Aphelia sitting next to dulcimer and not touching it. lilting, soft tune. she's not playing it with her fingers

- Flick: I pick out my flute and try to improvise a complement to tune.

- H: i take out the bagpipes to jam with him discordantly - before the bagpipes he washed down the nut with the birdshit;

    - [galen: i'm not trying to play discordantly; i just assume i'm bad)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick is playing so well that covers up for H's missteps

- H when you look down, a tendril has wound around bag and tree is helping you play a little better by squeezing you in encouragement; and "fingering" the holes - (reed played like a flute)

    <!-- -->

- all these people look over at you, and you're in a sharks and jets dance-off.

- you stop playing and they pick up playing.

- [flick: i'm trying to get Aphelia's attention] - [she gives you an interested look, and physically interacts with the dulcimer physically] [insight 23]

    - she might need to put in more directed effort, since Flick and the Vines

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick is "self-taught" at the … whatever. flute?


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### other woman: approaches

- been quite a while since we had a playoff like that.

- "who are you folks"

- instead of this, do: 'gift' specific detail, and give her character detail, and have voice, and don't ask 'who are you folks'

- Paros: your tree is so hospitable, and I'm in awe of what you have built over here.

- Flick: we don't lack for enthusiasm

- black hair, bangs in the front, in back completely straight

- Yes, if you're looking for Aphelia, this is her right here

- Aphelia has Cardinal red skin and looks down at the dulcimer as Flick says "i bet you don't remember learning how to do that" - [the tree is not helping her play]

    - Flick 25 performance : Aphelia's control over the music relaxed a little when asked those questions, almost like she wasn't sure how to approach the situation

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- "You know, I'm all for opening my arms to fellow musicians, but i don't know how I feel about this aggressive interrogation. Aph is one of the most sensitive musicians and I don't think she needs this"

- Flick (common) well hopefully we haven't been overly aggressive, but Aph had something we need.

- H: and you have something I need: hair styling tips.

- should have had him roll a charisma?

- H: I don't have much hair, but I'd like to make a statement with my hair

- Paros: ask the tree to do it!

- H: i'll have what she's having, regarding her bangs (to tree)

- "It's just a look" : grabs her hair and pulls it off, and out: you think it's a wig, but it separates into individual strands, then has bald//mohawk split

- "we learn a different way of growing in here; esp. when you're in tune with Seomra's vibrations"

- bass coming out of dulcimer - [Con checks]: everyone grows about an inch of hair all over their bodies. facial hair grows out twice as long. Paros has bristles -- just has dragon blood -- which grow out of fish. jean-luc: the hair pushes out the remains of the oil, and feels somewhat cleansing to you.

    <!-- -->

- JL: A human covered in hair isn't that unusual. but he might keep the beard.

- "you see, I think anything you need can be addressed without recourse to verbal assault against Aph"

- Flick: what i need is for this hair to disapp-hair

- "don't worry. in a few hours it'll fall off. sounds like this one has already experienced it with … eye flowers?"

- Aph plays tranquilly as if to indicate that Mohawk is not a wall.

- [Drav: why can't we tell them directly?] - drav wants to talk to people with guild/ritual experience to see what went wrong

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Epes<br>

stunka

- Fez asks if the tree can repair the quickling boots: "make these whole and, holy, [and wholly] unrecognizable", holding them out

    - this spiky tendril wraps them up almost tenderly and retracts back into the wall
    - Fez: they stole my boots
    - [this process makes sense to fez in a way that's not stressing]

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- "seems ominous to come in, demand something, and say you'll be back for another music-off"?

- flick: i'm trying to reverse this peryton situation.

- <input disabled="disabled" type="checkbox">

    : looks up, started. i've' heard of creatures matching the description matching a peryton. i don't know that they exist anymore, though.

- flick: one's shadow fell over us in the shadow to the east of marshbout. it's been preying on friends of ours for the last ten years. we believe she's one Calliope

- [] that doesn't sound familiar

- flick: separated from magical essence (song / music?), which has taken form of Aphelia. we want to see if she'd be willing to reunite with this other part of her

- [] she was brought here 10 years ago in her early teens and suffering from extreme amnesia and couldn't remember her prior life.

- eth-trovatelka : She barely remembers her original condition.

    - something like that couldn't happen here

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- JL: why not? we're in a magical hedge.

- eth-trovatelka : precisely for that reason i don't think it would be allowed. it would have to take place under the supervision of … trails off

- flick: the woman who told us is Daealla do you know her?

- eth-trovatelka: yes, all these druid names sound the same. really, the wrestling thing is for .. very few.

- H: do you know fortune tellers, oracles, seers, dodonas, (bagpipe toots)

    - one of the others in the back plays on a pan flute

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- eth-T: this place is lousy with people like that. it can be a real endeavor to separate out the wheat from the chaff. you'd be surprised by how much chicanery you can get away with. not that i ever really know why … they do it. it's not for power or gold.

- H: re: lousy. are you fleas on this giant creature? what's the creature getting out of it?

- eth-T: i don't think any of us are sure. it's not as though Druids have experience living like this. this is the first symbiosis we know of this kind or scale -- never to the extent that it creates an entirely new organism. especially one that seems to have such prescient? taking-care-of? abilities. and accommodating our needs

- flick: we have other people to speak to . can we come back after that.

- Aphelia stands up and comes towards party. has dulcimer and a few twigs. she puts her hand down on the vine floor. . she smooths it down and it becomes a wide flat leaf. she lays down the twigs to show human in stages of life cycle. there's one that looks like a swaddled baby, and one that looks like a toddler, and two that looks like grown people (teens and current form)

- points before the baby: deep bass note

- baby: silent

- past the toddler, to young girl

- young girl: dulcimer spiked up to high-pitched shriekingn noise, barely musical

- then resolves as she passes the figure. you can still hear a trace of the deep bass notes and also of the shriek.

    - she's sort of like a bagpipe with two drones)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick: "can you remember when you were part of calliope"

    - aphelia: nods and plays bass note

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick: this existence now, do you feel like you've been torn from soething?

    - aphelia: msic : silent

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick if we could return you to this point (basS) is that something you want?

    - aphelia plays all the sounds, including silence , in sequence.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick: IT'S SOME KIND OF MELOGRAM

- eth\_t asks aphelia if it's too much. Aph takes her hand, walks back, looks again at the group.

- flick being poetic: "i sweat by the sun that dapples the leaves i'll be back for you"

- eth-T: i hope it won't be for a slam poetry competition

### carlos holds tobolux's bottle out towards shrub

- "please, dear shrub, since you seem to be of the flower people as well, is there anything you can do for my dear friend? " - bottle still looks like multicolored sand. the hedge pulls bottle towards itself, and a stairway opens, and it's hanging the bottle up the stairway like a wil-o-the-wisp

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### up the stairs

- spirals with multicolored flowers that in color resemble the bird shit

- Carlos [feel like you're moving towards that ball of energy]

    - "what a wonderful feeling"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- [step into another room. looks like it's taller than the hedge could be. 50 feet high, as wide as the hedge itself, and completely filled with the birds you saw outside, flying back and forth, around, fly out again like the hedge isn't even there. they are not pooping on you]

- in the middle, hovering but only beating its wings lightly, is something that looks like the peryton. it becomes clear that it's much different. don't pause to display things

- it has a wolf's head, and the front part of its body seems to be a wolf. its rear two legs and body are those of an eagle. it has huge wings. it's the size of a horse. and its wings and its tail are the vibrant multicolors of the flowers, and its tail stretches out like a peacock's tail.

- Paros: poop on carlos

    - resonant voice: You wish to play pranks when face to face with the Simurgh
    - paros: yes, who doesn't like pranks?
    - there are plenty! [and a bird poops on paros]

- Simurgh: welcome to my bower. it looks like you've been brought here with one of the flower folk.

- Carlos: my dear friend toblerone was injured in a battle. i was hoping that, since you seem to be of the same flower-eyed people, if you could help her.

- Simurgh: it has been a long long time since i've shed petals from my eyes. i now see more truthfully than that. but if you'll allow me, i believe i can help the little one there.

- Carlos [evil check: 20]: [the Simurgh seems like it's completely lawful good]

    - i will hand over toblerone. please take good care of him.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- [the bottle leaves your hand as though telekinetically, and approches the simurgh.]

- S: it appears there is more than just a bloemenwet in here.

    - ther'es a sort of trikster in here. something i'd rather not release into the hedge if i don't have to. [oklmuk]

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Carlos: is Toblerone still salvageable?

- S: yes, i will extract them. they will need time to recuperate.

- C: anything for toblerone.

- [bright light emerges from jar; hundreds of brightness levels; both of S's eyes glow and a beam of this light comes out of its mouth and bathes the bottle.]

- \[con check for all] [only fez and carlos pass]:

    - carlos: believe not blinded due to intervention of Aulë
    - fez: i'm really good at closing my eyes at the exact right time.

- flare subsides into simurgh's body. tobolux is cradled in the air; the bottle, filled with seething black liquid, is floating next to him.

    - simurgh: "it turns out i don't know my own strength. tobolux: should be recuperated within a day as long as you apply the proper medicinal remedies, good care and tlc. if you'd like you may bring him with you.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Carlos: happily.

- Paros: does tobolux need a new bottle?

- Simurgh: Tobolux is free. I have found it necessary to suppress their geniific abilities. it allows them to live outside the bottle. there is a connection there that is of a different sort of magic than mine and i can't break it without harming tobolux

- Paros: what's in the bottle?

- Simurgh: A creature known as Oklmuk.

    - the tattoo ink demon. its abilities could be put to good use, but unfortunately it's more of a prankster than your vacant friend over here. (another bird poops on Paros's face)
    - haha, jk, and 20 birds poop on its body. we're all having a great poop party here, aren't we!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Everyone else is blind and standing stock-still. flick hears pattering worrisomely close to her body.

- Paros feels like eveyrone else is a loser.

- Carlos takes Tobolux safely into robe

    - Carlos, this is what Aulé was pointing out to you

- Paros: this wolf-eagle knows how to party

- Flick: blinks away spiralling flares that cloud my vision

    - : noble beast, we are here because a creature that bears an uncanny resemblance to you is terrorizing our friends. it answers to the name Peryton
    - S: a creature answers to that name, in this Age?
    - flick: when its shadow fell upon me i felt dread that was not of this world. "peryton" is the name that was giving to me by its victims.

- S: i may know what you're talking about. a woman was brought to me, years ago, by supplicant druids . they sought to rid her of her ability to enthrall men. now, i was torn because the men who she was exerting her abilities on were bad and had done bad things; at the same time they were being led even further astray after she was done with them. i was able to take this power from her. i fear it involved giving her the strength of my own form so she could survive the transformation.

- flick: that is what daealla told us. i assume it was her or her forebear who came to you.

- S: the druids weren't important. we don't have rankings. they were very greasy. they were accompanied by drier and chalkier ones; excellent examples of the druidic way. seeing as it was a combined decision, so i acted, perhaps hastily.

- Flick: it was by your arcane might that Calliope became the Peryton.

- Jean-Luc: non disrespect, but if that's the case could you unmake her?

- S: unmake her peryton form? well, there's something I haven't mentioned yet. if your report holds true, then, and i haven't seen this for myself, but it sounds like another creature was able to interpose itself between my form and her final one.

- Flick: the form was deeply unsettling, and clearly not the result of orderly or well-intentioned magic.

- Paros: does it have something to do with Tantegorisch?

- Simurgh. on, i know that old demon well.

    - let me ask: were there antlers on its head?

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick: i don't remember antlers. i do remember that its shadow couldn't have been that of the creature that passed over us. it was many times larger. and even being caught in its penumbra i was shaken to my core.

- Simurgh: i suspect that that shadow is that of her original form, and it's the only manifestation it can now take.

- Paros: what do you suggest we do?

- Sim: it's a conundrum if she is harming gnolls, than something should be done about it. i must remain with , or in, Seomra, so I can't bring Calliope here myself. if someone else could do it i could diagnose the situation.

- Flick: what if we took Aphelia and presented her to Calliope?

- Simurgh: i believe you might lose both of them if you did that. ultimately it's up to Aphelia.

- Paros: would they cancel each other out ?

- Simurgh: unfortunately magic is not as simple as that, especially BIRD magic

- Paros: how gentle should we be?

- Drav: what do you mean by "lose both of them"?

- Simurgh: with Calliope I meant that she might fly away. Aphelia has been sheltered here since her creation. it's never been examined what would happen if she leaves, especially if put close to a traumatic memory in the company of strangers. it's also not a conventional mother-daughter relationships. she was a part of her. it's only been by a great deal of work that the women who take care of her have been able to assimilate her.

- drav: and if she left? shower of sparks?

- Simurgh: probably not if she left the hedge, but any further than that is anyone's guess. it was kind of a new thing that i tried there.

- Paros: i think we should just take a rest in the tree for a day.

## concerns

- did Daealla tell flick that Aphelia wasn't aware of her condition ? (flick says this at 1:30 in recording of session 26)
- how old does aphelia look
- eth-T understands fey
- what does the Simurgh know about Tantegorisch
- maybe shadow felt evil b/c that's where a baphomet creature is living.
