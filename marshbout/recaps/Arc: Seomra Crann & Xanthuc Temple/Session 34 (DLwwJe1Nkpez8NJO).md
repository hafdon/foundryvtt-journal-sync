<div>Recap</div>

<div>Attempting to abscond with Aphelia — Jean-Luc the sheriff&nbsp;</div>

<div>Transcript</div>

<div>[incomplete]</div>

<div>stairway coming down are Jean-luc and Fez</div>

<div>Flick in the mix</div>

<div>Vengeance (and Eth Trovatelka — who I guess went somewhere else)</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick links elbows with Aphelia and turns to Alphalpha.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: Well, if there’s nothing futher, we’ll be on our way. Thanks and take care!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc takes the silver star out of his bag and waves it like a badge of authority.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: It’s ok guys, I’m going to take it from here. I’ve been tracking these two for a while. Don’t worry I’m going to take them to justice. Don’t worry, the young lady will have to give testimony, but I promise to have her back in an hour. [Deception 11]</div>

<div></div>

<div>The nearest elph to Jean-luc, Dalpholph sweet navy blue mohowk wearing horizontally striped green and orange robes.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Dalpholph: What makes you think that an agent wielding the Star of Tepplin can exercise any authority here?&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>[History 11] Jean-luc recognizes the name Tepplin; he knows it not to be a religious symbol. He knows enough about what it isn’t to recognize that what Dalpholph has said about its impotence here is probably correct.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Where I’m from, Tepplin is revered.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Dalpholph: Oh, so you’re from Albland. Seems a bit mercantilist to revere the star of a well-known brewer and distiller out in Albland.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: They make a really good brew; and it turns out that these people are wanted because they’ve been trying to steal our secret recipe. [Persuasion (could have been Deception again) 21].&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Dalpholph: It’s not like us to respect intellectual property in that way? I’ve been hearing a lot about it, too: People laying claim to secret recipes rather than putting them in the open. That’s a risk that Baronian takes: if the recipe is secret, and he doesn’t patent it, then if it’s stolen, that’s it.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc [Roll for patent law 18] remembers from his case-law studies Crebbers Vs. The Hoblands Guild, which upheld a similar situation, in which a mercenary was enlisted to recover an unpatented secret recipe. Because the Guilds can’t patent what they do, but they still manage to restrict who knows their methods by recourse to secret processes, recipes, and the like.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Well, yes, but according to Crebbers Vs. …. secrets are protected, even when not patented, so I’m here to discover what these two know, and then we’ll determine the appropriate course of action. I’ll have them back unharmed, and throw in a couple bottles to boot.</div>

<div>- Dalpholph: So, Aphelia, who’s mute, stole secret recipes?</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: I’m saying she might be in league with this elf over there, and we’re going to have to talk to both of them.</div>

<div>- Flick (to Aphelia): I was given to understand that Baronian was not aware of this particular emplacement. Have you led me off track, AGAIN? [Deception/Persuasion : failure]&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Dalpholph: I think discussing this makes a lot of sense; I’m not sure we’re going to allow you to take her out of here by force.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Certainly I have no desire to quarrell.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Drastically increasing the danger level, Aphelia plays an intractable mindworm on the flute to troll Flick. Jean-luc slowly and unthreateningly moves closer to Dalpholph, who stars moving to meet him.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Dalpholph (in a stage whisper): Now that I think about it, you could certainly help us stand up to this elf you’re after, who really kind of trounced us.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Of course! Tepplin has very little regard for brew … stealers.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Balgalaphus suddenly shoves Flick onto the ground. Falling, Flick invokes an unusual malediction (“little rascals apple dumpling gang motherfuckers”?), part of the northern Horth dialect, as Balgalaphus steps in between her and Aphelia.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Balgalaphus: What … was that? Did I hear you say apple? Is that a dig at the fact that Seomra refuses to grow apples? You must be referring to our sister tree.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick loses all sense of proportion as her butt makes contact with the ground, shouting in Abyssal, “Come now ravager of the Plains, as I unlease thee, so must thou unlease hell upon these fools”, summoning into being a Bestial Spirit named Gerd. A hole opens in reality, and out steps a miniature version of Ephatha, but quite a bit cuter. The portal opening up causes Seomra to do what looks like recoil in horror. Flick draws her rapier while Gerd chomps into Balgalaphus, who shrieks in pain. “What is this dark creature you’ve summoned?? I thought you were just a recipe stealer? What does this have to do with getting the rights to make beer?”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: I … don’t … know.</div>

<div>- Fez: I think you all understand how serious the threat to intellectual property is, now.</div>

<div>- Balgalaphus: I don’t understand why you would come back in here to get this woman; we had no idea if or what she’s involved in, and now you’ve created a ruckus!</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Yeah, I … just do what I’m told.</div>

<div>- Flick: This much is clear: Our party brings the ruckus.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Balgalaphus: RUCKUS… GET OVER HERE!</div>

<div></div>

<div>For Fez, this seems like a weird grift of the sort enacted by the pirates he spent time with in his younger days, but it’s not going very well. He gets his eyes up over the ledge, pulls a snacking ration out of his bag, and waits to see how it turns out. When reaching into the bag Fez discovers that the popcorn is incredibly wet, and the popcorn as (inversely) dry — so it takes like he’s sprinkling sand over algae. The popcorn has the size, shape, and consistency of cooked ravioli. Fez wonders if he ate some mushrooms? [Medicine 10] Something is weird. Fez knows how to salt and pack foodstuffs so they will be preserved, but something strange happened. Fez forgoes eatign it and whispers, “Hey, tree, can you take care of this,” while holding out the snacks to Seomra. Seomra takes a flower-sniff, and then retreats. A venus fly trap sticks its tongue out, spits onto the ground, and retreats back into the tree. Fez packs up the snack and puts it in his bag.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Carlos notes at least two ruckuses and, with his superior dwarven hearing (?) has heard the conversations ‘downstairs.’&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Carlos (To Drav): Do you want to go down and check it out, or do you want to stay here by this wishing tree and eat apples?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Drav: It sounds like we might be needed downstairs.</div>

<div>- Carlos: OHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhkay, Drav.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Carlos sneaks down the stairs and sits next to Fez. Offered some popcorn, he sees nothing wrong with the soppy medallions and swallows a few handfuls. It’s a little funky, but no weirder than some of the adderwort algae he used to eat after gathering it from the cave pools. However, it distinctly tastes unlike popcorn. But it’s very cheesy. “I’ve eaten worse!” said Carlos, continuing to slurp.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Gerd: Master, why are you letting the elphs attack me like this? (And it backs up into you like a dog doing the backwards hump jump)</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick, only half-away that she’s the reason it’s here, doesn’t respond.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Meanwhle, Cyrowan comes down the stairs, sniffs Fez’s pack and motions for a sample. Fez points to some of the popcorn that is on the stairs; Cyrowan has already started moving towards Carlos, snatches what’s in his hands, then snuffles up the crumbs.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Aphelia plays a song on her flute. Flick and Jean-luc find themselves unable to move as they soak in the extraordinarily calming melody she’s begun to play. The Elphs are affected a little more strongly, and all but Balgalaphus and Jerephala, are affected in the same way. Gurd : “Master, was this you calming them all? They’ve stopped attacking me.”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: I’m sorry I dragged you into this.</div>

<div>- Gerd (imprinting on Flick): I’m not. I love this intimate interaction we’re able to have.</div>

<div></div>

<div>A muffled clomping of hooves is heard.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Ruckus: Ruckus is here! Was I called for? I can see that one of the nethercreatures has made its way into our sacred grove. (She fires two arrows into Gurd).&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: poor creature!</div>

<div>- Ruckus: don’t declare it a poor creature! it is evil, and whoever summons it is likewise evil.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-Luc (stage whisper): I thought maybe we could … persuade … it to be on our side.</div>

<div>- Ruckus: What’s this about persuasion? I love to enter into dialog.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Vengeance walks up and looks nervously at Gerd. “I’m a deliveryman and I have a delivery for Jean-Luc, the famous brewer? It says here you’re … the sheriff of Brew Town? I guess that would be you, then, holding that star?”</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Yep, that’s me! You’re a total stranger to me!.</div>

<div>- Vengeance (handing Jean-luc a bag of dead rats): Great, well I have one large order of … ‘secret ingredient’&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc has no idea what Vengeance is doing, whether it’s a grift or a prank. Jerephala, who bears a very very passing resemblance to Lydia, makes eyes at Jean-luc, says, “Oh, my my, a sheriff, how intriguing!” as the other elphs tisk her.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: This is hardly the time, or the place.</div>

<div>- Jerephala: Oh, very businesslike I see! That’s really something.</div>

<div>- Vengeance: Yes, it says here on my clipboard: “Most powerful sheriff in all the 28 kingdoms.” I don’t know why it would say that, but … he seems like a pretty big guy.</div>

<div>- Jerephala: A little bit of puffery never hurt anyone.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: It’s hard work being so great. Unfortunately I do have a job to do.</div>

<div>- Jerephala: Perhaps I could convince you to return when your job is done. Or is it really that urgent in the first place?</div>

<div>- Jean-luc. Of course, the Tepplin Brewery takes this sort of thing very seriously … but it’s contingent on me getting out of here with my quarry.&nbsp;</div>
