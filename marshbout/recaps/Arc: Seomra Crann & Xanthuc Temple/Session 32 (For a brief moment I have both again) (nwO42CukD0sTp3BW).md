# Recap

<div>Vek pushes its flesh agenda on Hiero and Jean-luc. Fez refutes Abzû. Amalia, unturned, is killed. Rotrude gives the gift of boils and her handskin. Vek makes a plea for its life. Jean-luc finally gets a star.</div>

# Transcript

<div>Jean-luc, operating under the impression that he is an unmoving puddle of flesh, attempts to gather himself up again using his own dissolving form. Through his lo-res eyespots he is able to locate himself vaguely in the room; occupying the site of the soil on the bar table is a nebulous swirling cloud of dirt and starlight mineral sparkles.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: You have a lot of anxiety. Perhaps just relax into your new form. Why are you resisting this after just having invoked my powers?</div>

<div></div>

<div>This rumbling spirit voice can be heard only by Jean-luc and Hieronymus. Hieronymus goes to pour his liquid self into the vase to become one with the spirit.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: Yes, you are already quite of the flesh. I can tell that you, Hieronymus, know the relationship that transpires here.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc thinks that the process can be interrupted if he lets the spirit know what is actually going on. More panicked than anything, he attempts to move towards the bar. The intense training he's done over the years is not available to him, and he only slides about ten feet forwards. It feels to him as though he's rolling a fleshball.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: You won't be able to take advantage of what I have to offer if you resist like this.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: I'm kind of a fan of having bones.</div>

<div>- Vek: Why did you even come here, then?</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: It's a long story. I'm just along for the ride. You may have gotten the wrong idea. I ... didn't mean to offer myself.</div>

<div>- Vek: Have no doubt you will get your bones back. I can see that already you are intellectualizing this experience, whereas the point is to retreat into yourself, and 'lose' your bones.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean.</div>

<div>- Flick: Who would seek out such an experience?</div>

<div>- Vek: I can hear your friend, but I cannot talk to her unless she becomes one with my network.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: That's a hard pass.</div>

<div>- Vek: One more step closer and I can offer that to her.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez, experiencing a lot of new things with his friends around, goes to push over the vase, [Athletics 12], really putting his "fish-man" scale-mailed shoulder into it. As he does so, the room rotates around him, the vase, and the table (on a horizontal axis) in the opposite direction that he's pushing. Flick sees that Fez is falling backwards to the floor after initially touching the vase. Fez, desirous of resetting the room, stops pushing the vase and comes to, prone on the ground. Fez notices that his carrying bag is beginning to undulate gently. Upon looking inside, he sees that the conch shell found on the sand after the shipwreck of the Majestic Elk is overflowing with dirt, and that thick green (in between nature and evil) tentacles are emerging from the dirt, like a hermit crab's claws. He takes the conch from the top and places it on the ground.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Abzu: Fez, come to collect on our pact, have you.</div>

<div>- Fez: New phone, who dis.</div>

<div>- Abzu: My name is Abzu; it's "short" for Adzub. It is likely that your weak half human frame was too discombobulated at the time the pact was made to remember the finer details.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>A rapid-fire clarification of the orthography of the creature's name takes place. Suddenly, the inimitable voice seems to trigger a memory in Fez. ... is it a boomerang? No. It's a "memory boomerang" from the sea. As the Majestic Elk was destroyed, and he was dragged under the surface of the ocean, the cries of the sailors of "Kraken!" reverberated in his mind, and he found himself wrapped in massive, thick tentacles. His eyes regained focus to find himself staring into huge expressionless eyes, churning like a hurricane. For one of the few times in his life, his self-confidence and ego were subsumed beneath a desperate plea for his life. (This couldn't be right, Fez thinks. I'd never do that.) In the memory, Abzu, for that was the kraken, let him live, as long as he committed to a pact: when it was requested, he would act in service of the beast. Some time later he found himself cast up onto the shore with the conch.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez remembers seeing it. The fact that he wasn't confident at the time couldn't be right, but it does seem like it happened to him. Unable to process something like this, he tries to turn away from the months of depression he thought might ensue.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Abzu: There's no need to be depressed. The power I'm willing to give you will compensate for any transient emotional distress.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: It doesn't sound like a great deal, and it conflicts with my visions of more benevolent sea monsters.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Abzu: What is there about me that's not benevolent?</div>

<div>- Fez: Your creepy voice, your tentacles, and the destruction of a ship.</div>

<div>- Abzu: Well that ship was in my waters -- and many of those aboard were enemies of the Krakens.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: Why?</div>

<div>- Abzu: They are a coastal people and have animosity towards those who wish to share the sea with them.</div>

<div>- Fez: It doesn't seem like you're sharing the sea with them at all -- you were the aggressor.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Abzu: After they demonstrated they were xenophobic, I decided to trade them an eye for an eye.</div>

<div>- Fez: So the things people did to you, you did back to them. That's not benevolent.</div>

<div>- Abzu: I protect the sea creatures.</div>

<div>- Fez: What do you eat?</div>

<div>- Abzu: Algae.</div>

<div>- Fez: You sure?</div>

<div>- Abzu: That's it.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez is pretty sure that algae and plankton go towards its diet.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Abzu: The blue whale is even larger than I am, and it's sustained on krill.</div>

<div>- Fez: Yeah but it's a mammal.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Abzu: Right, so its metabolism is even higher.</div>

<div>- Fez: So you're saying it's worse than you?</div>

<div>- Abzu: Is a tortoise worse than a mouse?</div>

<div>- Fez: Yes.</div>

<div>- Abzu: You were only recently riding on a turtle.</div>

<div>- Fez: How do you know that?</div>

<div>- Abzu: You made a pact with me!</div>

<div>- Fez: That doesn't sound right. Can you show me where I signed?</div>

<div>- Abzu: It's not my fault that mortal memory is so easily destroyed.</div>

<div>- Fez: None of this adds up correctly.</div>

<div>- Abzu: Fine, if you don't believe me, the next time you go to swipe at one of these many enemies -- attend to what occurs, and it will be clear that I provide your power to you.</div>

<div>- Fez: Even if that's true, what were the terms of the pact?</div>

<div>- Abzu: When I need you, you will be there to serve me. A war is brewing, and even these minor excursions by the Teallacht could be dissuaded with your involvement.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: Why are you talking to me now?</div>

<div>- Abzu: Something about the way you lost life after we made our pact rendered our continued conversations impossible. Through the influence of Vek, you are reduced to what is fundamental about your body, and that has allowed me to talk to you again.</div>

<div>- Fez: Can we return to our previous relationship? Where you shut the fuck up and I go on my way?</div>

<div>- Abzu: If you wish</div>

<div>- Fez: Great -- so be it. And a reminder that this is the first pact I've made with you.</div>

<div></div>

<div>A discussion of bags, shells, and halfling racism ensues as Fez and Abzu attempt to hang up on one another.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: Yeah -- our adventuring team only has one famous hobbit!</div>

<div></div>

<div>(From the outside room)</div>

<div>- Amalia: Carlos!!</div>

<div>- Flick: What the fuck was that?</div>

<div></div>

<div>With Flick's superior elven hearing she can determine that Amalia is still quite far down the hallway. Hieronymus meanwhile slides into Vek's DMs in an attempt to pour himself into the vase.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hieronymus: Yes, spirit, let us commune. Let me absorb your nutrients and grow into the mighty oak that I have always longed to be.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: Before you become the oak, you must become a grub.</div>

<div>- Hieronymus: I thought if anything I'd have to become an acorn first.</div>

<div>- Vek: Acorns are much tougher and resilient than those who come to me wish to be. But you may crawl towards me slowly, little grub.</div>

<div>- Hieronymus: Uh..... ok!</div>

<div>- Vek: When you mortify yourself, do you know about the energy that ... flows through the universe.</div>

<div>- Hieronymus: ... what? Yes, I know all about that. Am I not talking to myself?</div>

<div>- Vek: This is Vek. Victor. Echo. Karate.</div>

<div>- Hieronymus: Well, Mr. Vik, I agree, I'd like to become part of you. May we commune in a beautiful fusion of flesh and soil?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: Yes, I'm glad I don't have to convince you like I do Jean-luc.</div>

<div>- Heiro: Yes, he's just an old fuddy-duddy who never wants to do anything fun.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc (nodding): Yeah, both of you enjoy your blood orgy.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez [Con 5], hearing Vek's low-decibel, extra-low-frequency whispers, hurls chunks all over the place.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: I quite like this "Not having any bones" thing. Bones, as it turns out, were an unnecessary luxury. Life is a lot simpler this way. I can't wait to harvest this divine energy so I become even more powerful.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: The way to the divine energy is to let go of your bones. To become nothing but flesh.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Hiero: So, mission accomplished!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus then passes out. Void. Small elven boy. Equally as weird looking. At the horizon of his tunnel his parents are fishing. Instead of physical forms he sees their ki. But looking down at himself he just sees his body: the body of a child. His parents turn to look back at him; as they do he feels an intense, direct hostility coming from them. Then they are yanked out of his vision, and he's left there with no one to protect him.&nbsp;</div>

<div> - Kid Hiero: Mommy, daddy! Why are you gone before I got a chance to tip your boat over and drown you?!</div>

<div> - Mom: Heiro, you were always such a rascal. We don't know where you got it from, but it's too much for us, and we're done with you.</div>

<div> - Kid Hiero: Ohh. Where will I find my ki now? My ky. The key to my existence.</div>

<div> - Mom: If only you would stop looking -- perhaps then, it will emerge from within you, rather than always stay out of your grasp.</div>

<div> - Kid Hiero: Stop looking, you say.</div>

<div> - Mom: Indeed.</div>

<div>The sky appears to wink, and Kid Heiro takes a whittled wooden dagger and stabs them into his eyes, just like the darts into Shoemaker Byte's eyes. As he does that, he suddenly sees, even eyeless, the pure representation of ki across the night sky. He then wakes up, on the floor of the bar.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: All has been revealed to me. From this day forward, I shall have a new name: VENGEANCE.</div>

<div>- Vek: Everyone doooooes experience it differently.</div>

<div>- Fez: Maybe we need to overload the dirt with non-dirt.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Carlos: Curse this backwards! Curse your curse nuts!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Carlos calls down the divine energy of Aulë to rend the vase apart, but the vase merely jiggles excitedly and settles back on the table.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Carlos: My Hammer! Shatter this perverted symbol of vulgarity!</div>

<div></div>

<div>The hammer courses towards the glass container and smashes against it. A crack running from base to rim forms, and soil begins to drain out of the vase. Jean-luc for a brief moment senses his cool sturdy bones. He rises to his feet, throwing off the hallucination like a blanket, confident in his sprightly frame. He grabs the kettle and goes to wing it at the vase.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: I can finally come up there! Perhaps we can make our way to your dental appointment together.</div>

<div>- Hiero: I am a changed man, now. I wish to make up with you and go fishing and huckleberry'ing as we once did.</div>

<div>- Flick: Don't be a simp, Heironymus!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: That sounds wonderful. Perhaps this time we might bring a chaperone in case one of us needs resuscitation.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Heiro: Well, we're adults. I think we can handle ourselves.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Rotrude: I certainly believe that you can handle yourself, but I think I might need assistance. I don't know if you were able to drag me from the depths as quickly as I'd like.</div>

<div>- Heiro: I'm kind of like ... the most powerful person in the world now. I don't have time to explain.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Have you been off on one of your meditative journeys again? And what is this fascinating energy coming from the room you're in.</div>

<div>- Heiro: That is the dirt spirit.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Well I will be right up, and perhaps we do find a chaperone.</div>

<div>- Heiro: Well, Jean-luc here looks up to me as a mentor and is a good friend, and might fit the bill.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: I do not look up to you as a mentor, you crazy asshole!</div>

<div>- Heiro: Well then Jean-luc perhaps you would like to be the first to jump into the swirling dirt here.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Your friend sounds audibly disgusted! There is quite a lot of dry-heaving coming from that room.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick, encouraged by the crack in the vase, leaps ten feet towards the table on which it rests. She sees Rotrude, dressed in simple blacks and greys and dripping with brackish water, through the open door. She fires a force-arrow at it, but it wraps around the vase like light bending in water. Forgoing a sharpshoot opportunity, she looses a regular arrow, quickly retreating out of the proximity of the vase. Fez, having had a moment to strategize, lashes his whip towards the vase in the hopes of dragging it off the table; the heavy vase smashes against the floor, the lid smashing but the vase remaining upright, still spilling dirt.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: There's no need to destroy me. I was only being invited into your minds by Shoemaker. People usually come to me of their own volition.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez recognizes the possible truth of this plea.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: If you want "Live and let live," can you ... go dormant? And we can just leave you?</div>

<div>- Vek: I wouldn't mind if you deposited my soil in a local ... heap ... of soil.</div>

<div>- Fez: I, Fezziwig Hornswoggle, (making the 2nd pact of my life) --</div>

<div>- Abzu: &lt;Would you like to renew our pact?&gt;</div>

<div>- Fez: No!</div>

<div>- Vek: Was that a benevolent kraken talking to you?</div>

<div>- Fez: It was a non-benevolent kraken.</div>

<div>- Vek: I know of no such thing.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: You're literally dirt.</div>

<div>- Vek: Dirt is only the vessel through which I can become manifest.</div>

<div>- Fez: Then how do you know about water creatures?</div>

<div>- Vek: I don't understand the question.</div>

<div>- Fez: You retreat your presence into your soil; we will take you out to an inviting spot and deposit you there.</div>

<div>- Flick (embarrassed at having missed a stationary pot): I agree wholeheartedly</div>

<div>- Hiero: I agree as well, as long as you allow me to become the seed I have always wanted to be, and implant myself into the soil so that I may become a mighty oak.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Anything that lets me keep my bones is ok with me.</div>

<div>- Vek: The bones always come back after a time.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: Not good enough.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: Heiro, since when have you taken such an interest in plant-life. I thought you were more of a poison guy.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Heiro: Well yes, poison comes from plants. When I was a boy, all I ever wanted to be was a tree.</div>

<div>- Vek: This is fascinating. and you were aware of this before today's visions?</div>

<div>- Heiro: Yes, I was. But now -- I have a renewed purpose. Like when you come back from a year abroad. I know now that I cannot simply be a tree (altho I would like to try that at some point). I have to find the sorceress and give her a good wallop after I am powerful enough to do so.</div>

<div>- Vek: As a plea for my continued accompaniment, if you look inwards towards yourself you will see that our interaction has renewed your connection with Ki. [Heiro recovers 6 ki points.]</div>

<div>- Fez: If I wanted to dispose of a seashell and have it decompose in the dirt. And the malevolent presence inside it.</div>

<div>- Vek: Yes, it could work. There is a risk that it could escape from the physical constraint. A pretty high risk. I don't like to overestimate my skills.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: Is it like a minimal effort for you? Or you and Hieronymus could co-exist with that power.</div>

<div>- Vek: If it's a shell, I'm not sure I would be up to the task. It's hard to convince a shell to return to its fleshy blob state.</div>

<div>- Fez: What about a kraken?</div>

<div>- Vek: A little tadpole kraken?</div>

<div>- Fez: Yeah ... he fits in this shell.</div>

<div>- Vek: Then possibly.</div>

<div>- Fez: Well what if it happens to be a small version of a larger kraken.</div>

<div>- Vek: I am good at suppressing spirits if they can be isolated from their physical forms. It's rare for krakens to be spirits, though.</div>

<div>- Fez: Can they communicate at a distance?</div>

<div>- Vek: If you made a pact with them. The Quacken.</div>

<div>- Fez: I'm not typically in the business of not honoring my pacts, so I'll just keep it.</div>

<div>- Vek: You're the kind of guy who, no matter what he's doing, _thinks_ he's honoring a pact.</div>

<div>- Fez: That is deeply true. Because of tautology.</div>

<div>- Vek: This explains a lot, really.</div>

<div>- Fez: Are you and Hieronymus going to become a tree together?</div>

<div>- Vek: Hieronymus may have misunderstood what the soil component of me is for.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Hieronymus: All I wanted was to soil myself. I don't understand why that's so hard</div>

<div>- Rotrude: We can soil one another together once I get up there!</div>

<div>- Hiero: I know I said we could be friends again, but that was a passing mood, so I don't want to see you.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: So you want a 'two-hurls-one-monk' situation?</div>

<div>- Hiero: No. No.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Why not? If you don't desire me, what do you wish for?</div>

<div>- Heiro: I can take care of it. Just please retreat to your dungeons or your catacombs, wherever you came from. [Fails a persuasion check]</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Oh, I can tell you're just kidding. I'll be right up.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc moves as far as he can from Vek and upturns a bottle of disgusting, yet effective, hard spirits. The liquid is quite murky. Fez notices that one of his whip tassles is poking out of Vek's soil, and he goes to wiggle it free, but comes up with just a root.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: I do love a good head massage. Whatever you want to call it.</div>

<div>- Fez: My apologies.</div>

<div>- Vek: Yes, you are coming to know yourself through my intervention.</div>

<div>- Fez: NOW who's overly confident?</div>

<div>- Vek: I'm a spirit. I'm allowed to be.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez and Vek discuss the notion of an entity's right to be overconfident. Turns out, The Best The First Halfling said "Freedom is a right of all living beings." Fez agrees to 'companion' his friends to help Vek back onto the table. Amalia runs into the room, past the dissipated vapors of Eldar.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Amalia: Carlos, I can't be held responsible for what I'm about to do after you abandoned me in that cave-in only to come in here for a drink. ... Like I said, no one could blame me for not being able to hit.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Amalia hits him with a crossbow bolt which retains a tenebrous tether to her, which throbs with stolen life energy.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Amalia: I'll take from you the life that you denied to me!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Do I hear the pitter-patter of my dear Hiero's feet.</div>

<div>- Hiero: I just want to live my life, MAN!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Displacing his anger onto this new arrival, Hieronymus batters Amalia with his Karbunqlestaph. Hieronymus slides down his staff, sliced by the protruding thorns and lubricating it with blood. While being drained, Carlos, not his usual self, wiffs with his battleaxe and coughs unhelpfully. Then Rotrude comes in!&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: We can finally tussle like we're used to. Just get those little hammy fists up, let me see what we can do!</div>

<div>- Hiero: Hammy?&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>With her jagged, shredded nails she claws into Hieronymus, and where she slashes the monk his skin begins to bubble with blueish blisters, and a mild neuropathy settles into his limbs.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: I hope you like this bit of torture I've devised. It allows for a bit more pain during our sparring.</div>

<div>- Hiero: A touch of hurt, you say?</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hiero squeezes a boil and a thick, blue liquid jets out and into Rotrude's eye, which immediately swells and takes on the cast of one of the boils themselves.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: What have you done? This isn't what I agreed to!</div>

<div>- Hiero: I'm sorry but it seems as though you broke the rules, and the gloves are off.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: How interesting that you should say that!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Rotrude pulls off the skin of her hands up to the elbows, like gloves.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: A duel it is, then!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick, worried about Carlos and attempting to suppress the revulsion at what she witnessed with Rotrude, closes to within two rods, shatters the very fabric of Amalia's being, and then shoots an arrow into Rotrude.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: Is this part of the new techniques you mentioned?</div>

<div>- Hiero: Stay still while I make a portrait of you!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: You should use some fluid from the boils on your arm!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc skips into the fray and delivers another deep wound.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: Distance fighters look to be your main companions now?</div>

<div>- Hiero: These are my followers; they haven't learned how to fight yet.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc and Flick: Don't lump us in with him!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Given the distance between all of you: we already have a strong friendship foundation; yet you all treat each other as the same pole on a magnet.</div>

<div>- Fez (after a long delay): what's a magnet?</div>

<div>- Rotrude: What about the concept of magnetism?</div>

<div>- Fez: What? The compass points the direction. North.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez then "applies" a whipping.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: I thought you said you were going to give me a solid whipping, not a one-and-done.</div>

<div>- Fez: I genuinely thought you couldn't take another hit and felt pity for you.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: I doubt that this human frame can withstand much more. In the monastery we are taught many ways to consider the human form.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: Yeah, well, to me, you look like an undead horror show.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Hieronymus, utterly fed up, tears the undead monk to pieces.</div>

<div>- Hiero: Perhaps we shall meet again.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Yes, we will always be twins, circling one another, like two halves of a symbolon.</div>

<div>- Hiero: I'm not sure I would go that far.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Would you go to the ends of the earth for me?</div>

<div>- Hiero: Well, that's not that far.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: Yes, the monastery taught us we live on a very very small, two-dimensional planet. Goodbye my hairy mouse!</div>

<div>- Hiero: Goodbye my lovely serpent sister.</div>

<div>- Flick (After a beat): Enough of that pervert shit.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The gang listens intently for footsteps; Fez, glancing around the room, casts his eyes over Shoemaker, her greataxe, the skin of Rotrude's de-gloved hands. Flick dances sprightly over to Carlos and tries to draw any evil out of him and into the void.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Carlos: I think I just need to sleep for a long time -- regain my ruddy dwarven complexion -- and this will all go away like a bad dream.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick hands him a goodberry, and he chokes it down despite his nausea and Shoemaker's warnings. The wood elf then trips over to Shoemaker's body, determining for good that she's a bear only with opposable thumbs and the ability to walk upright with ease. Flick remembers that ordinary folks think of these things as ursothropes, but there doesn't appear to be any shapechanging going on, as such creatures are supposed to return to their "default" state at death.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: What am I supposed to make of this!</div>

<div></div>

<div>She's not a werecreature, and this is probably just her species, a kind of permanently hybrid species. [Int 1] She is from an ancient line of humans, from which druids "evolved." Flick picks up 39 uncrushed goodberries which dropped out of Shoemaker's paws upon her earlier entrance. They are vines, like grapes -- not like the individual and separate berries she typically receives; they clearly grow somewhere, which she would never have guessed before. The one rotten goodberry that appeared at Castle Karn had really freaked her out.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick (mumbling to herself): Yes, the humans I know _are_ pretty hairy. I don't want to skin a sapient creature.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Her hand briefly touches some of the soil.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Vek: The berries, they grow around Shoemaker's house.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: Sorry about trying to break your vase. Sorry about that.</div>

<div>- Vek: That means a lot.</div>

<div>- Flick: How did you get here? I had always heard that she lived near where I grew up. Did you take some kind of portal here?</div>

<div>- Vek: My jar is in Shoemaker's basement. I'm not just waiting in there, though. People have to come by and invoke me. I'm always popping up all over the place.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Flick: so Shoemaker summoned you once she had tracked me down. If we were to scatter your soil, you'd be able to unbind and return whence you came.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Vek: Unbinding isn't a problem but I don't like to have unnecessary duplicates of myself hanging around.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Flick finagles the vase into the bag of holding, while Jean-luc notices that the kettle radiates indeterminate magic.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Carlos: Aule seems to think this is more druid magic rather than anything arcane.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: Hey, I bet I know what that thing does. You take crabs, and boil them -- then the shells go all soft and you can get into the meat.</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: I do enjoy a good seafood feast.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Jean-luc grabs some clarified alcohol in a distinctive bottle bearing a silver eight-pointed star etched into the bottle. Hiero goes over to Jean-luc, puts a chair behind him.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: Jean-luc, why don't you sit down for a second, there's something we have to talk about. [Jean-luc remains standing] I know that you think we came down here to fight some undead creatures, but actually this is an intervention. I'd like you to give me your bottles; i'll keep them safe. To make headway we need you at 100%, and you weren't really all that much help in the last bottle.</div>
