<div>## Xanthu(c) Diaspora, Heironymus’s knowledge thereof</div>

<div></div>

<div>- doubt that they were bagpipe players</div>

<div>- most were humans</div>

<div>- some of them probably used mules as beasts of burden</div>

<div>- about 54% chance of you coming across living inhabitants of these villages if you went off to search for them</div>

<div>- how would they greet adventurers?&nbsp;</div>

<div> - they'd be shocked you got out of the temples, or weren't turned into slaves or sacrifices</div>

<div></div>

<div>## The Chamber of Xanthu</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Angela establishes XANTHU as the antagonist in a scooby doo cartoon. When "These rocks look great" wore out he merged back into the wall.</div>

<div></div>

<div>## Exploring the subterranean chamber</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero wants to shimmy down the column supporting him, which is the exact shape of his body. He slides carefully down, lowering himself from the edge of the column to where it is safe for him to jump on the rubble below.</div>

<div>- Drav hangs from the temple floor and jumps down.</div>

<div>- They can see the far end of the chamber to a set of stairs which proceed further down. Drav's [Perception 20] notices that the floor is irregular and not level. She discerns a kind of intaglio physiognomy, as though a huge face is emerging.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Jake: was Xanthu upstairs scary or beautiful? DM: he was utilitarian in appearance.</div>

<div>- Drav [Arcana 5] is slightly apprehensive that the floor-face might come to life; but, upstairs, Xanthu's face and vitality were synchronic.</div>

<div>- Carlos drops nimbly into the chamber.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>## Amalia Broadbeam</div>

<div></div>

<div>- [Perception !25] Amongst the rubble and kobold body parts is a newly made pair of leather boots connected to legs. [Athletics 19] Carlos shoulders away the boulders and crushed and amputated limbs, gradually uncovering the body of an unconscious dwarf. [Intelligence 7] Carlos realizes this is his old friend, Amalia Broadbeam. When Carlos would travel to heal communities, you would often travel together. She was a practiced carpenter; you would both build stone and wooden structures, build hospitals, dig wells and irrigation troughs. [Medicine good] She's not breathing, but she is moving, making small regular motions; her hands tremble slightly and her mouth is moving as if to mumble in dream. Carlos tries Spare the Dying, which has no effect on the dwarf.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Suddenly she opens her eyes. Amalia is very confused to be underground; the last thing she remembers is building a shelter for halflings at the mouth of a cave in the Braided Mountains next the Talion Valley.</div>

<div>- Carlos confirms she isn't injured and reassures her of her safety.</div>

<div>- Hiero walks over with his shortsword and offers to put her out of her misery.</div>

<div>- Carlos waves him off and tells Amalia he's a weirdo.</div>

<div>- Amalia: "having that little hair on my head would drive me to suicide"</div>

<div>- Heiro: "The only sense in which i'm weird is that I'm your fate if you are not careful."</div>

<div>- Amalia is shocked and bemused that he's invoking the ideas of the Old Gods, and asks where he learned about it.</div>

<div>- Heiro, "I spent many years studying under the great elf Horoxicron, who taught me many things, among them, the arcana of the weird dragons of Persipoly.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Amalia: Oh, -- the dragon notions are different than ours, but they still have Weirds?</div>

<div>- Hiero: the dragons are actually the ones controlling the gods that once lived in this temple.</div>

<div>- Amalia: what temple?</div>

<div></div>

<div>## Rotrude Meletorix</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Coming up the stairs at the end of the passageway Hiero sees Rotrude, another elf who was also an ascetic.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- She looks similar to the last time Heiro saw her. Wearing a periwinkle skullcap, beautiful dark blue with vertical white lines cassock, and double-strapped monk boots. However, she's dripping wet. [Intelligence 11] Last he saw Rotrude, she drowned in a lake nearby. THey were out together; he can't quite remember what they were doing. Maybe she got too deep in the lake, or maybe Hiero had tripped and brought her down with you. She was drowned and dead before the monks could revive her.</div>

<div>- Rotrude approaches Hiero. "Fine, you got me," Hiero reluctantly confirms his identity just as he notices her blood-red eyes.</div>

<div>- Heiro: Rotrude, can it really be you? And look at those contacts!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: On the contrary, i've had contact with very few since ... it was only a few minutes ago that we last saw each other. I came up out of the lake and you were gone. We had been fishing and reminiscing about your parents, Gorenchim and Weldemoet.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Hiero: please don't bring them up.</div>

<div>- Rotrude, yes, it did get quite heated.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Amalia: "who is that ... and who are the rest of you?"</div>

<div>- Carlos: Most are my friends, except for the new one.</div>

<div>- Fez finishes his seaweed jerky and hears too many people talking below.</div>

<div>- Carlos, "Is there any jerky left? Dangit!"</div>

<div>- Fez, somewhere deep in his subconscious, begins to contemplate braiding together the grape and seaweed jerky.</div>

<div></div>

<div>## Fez drops in</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez, "There's a bit of a crowd down here" [Perception 23].&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Drav had discovered a secret door in the far corner of the temple floor; Fez sees a chainmail hood off of which glitters chartreuse light emanating from the stairway, as though a body is coming headfirst into the passageway.</div>

<div>- "Well if it isn't Fezziwig Hornswoggle. My dearest 20th 1st cousins four times removed."</div>

<div>- Fez, "Why are you here? family reunions are every five years and we just had one last year"</div>

<div>- A short discussion of identity ensues unfruitfully</div>

<div>- I'm one of the Wortpullers, Laceleaf. (She lives in Torffeton 50 miles west? east? of Cressida, a little halfling town near the Gath Valley and Toofy Lake)</div>

<div>- Carlos expresses disappointment that Fez has so many relatives.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez Divine Sense: These are all undead (he can't tell about Laceleaf, she's too far away)</div>

<div> - Fez is uncomfortable with how far away he can sense things. BUT HE'S NOT SCARED.</div>

<div>- Carlos: am i getting the heebie jeebies from the elf?&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez [Intelligence 15]: her parents, Freetricia and Elbow Wortpuller, were ailing, and she left them home alone; she wanted to go out and carouse with friends and 19th-21st cousins, 61 times removed ?? The town was struck by an unpredictable snowstorm, and they died. Her brother, went out and it was rumored that he was going to bring her back or something worse. This got to you second or third hand.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez says BRAVELY: I think ... our friends ... don't seem to be alive. Currently.</div>

<div>- Carlos: hey, what are you trying to say??</div>

<div>- Fez: I agree, this resembles my cousin. But just ... can't you smell it? And Carlos notices the smell.</div>

<div>- Fez is WIGGED OUT BUT STOIC</div>

<div>- Rotrude and Laceleaf start walking towards you</div>

<div>- Laceleaf: Fez, I know that you left your parents back home, just to farm without you. That's not a great idea. You should take care of family.</div>

<div>- Fez: they can take care of themselves.</div>

<div>- Laceleaf: that's what i thought, but they need their kids.</div>

<div>- Fez: sometimes you have to go your own way.</div>

<div>- Laceleaf: i'm gonna make sure you get back to your folks.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>## The Parent (and Cousin and Friend) Trapped&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Xanthu: I TOLD YOU YOU'D HAVE TO HELP ME, and the rubble rises to re-form the ceiling/floor&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez is so perceptive that he gets a free action before combat. He activates his heelys&nbsp;</div>

<div> - by the sea, i'll return you to the depths one way or another, and casts Blessing of the Sea</div>

<div>- they yell about what "depth" means</div>

<div>- in the conversational commotion, some leeches fall out of Rotrude's ear</div>

<div></div>

<div>## Combat</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez divine smites Rotrude</div>

<div>- Rotrude: If only you used your whip as a flog, I might have supplicated myself in punishment before the divine.</div>

<div> - moderately sexually compelling to Hiero. Only about 300 years old</div>

<div>- Hiero: Forgive my skepticism, but the last time we saw each other, you were dead, and the real Rotrude only wore one strap on her boots. If i could put you to a test. I'm going to play a tune on the bagpipes, and you play the next note (he plays three notes and hands her the bagpipes)</div>

<div>- Rotrude can't breathe, so no air goes into the bladder. "I think it is clogged?"&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Heiro shakes the instrument, and a ballgag drops out.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Rotrude: I have this extra bootstrap, and you have that extra strap. it angers me that you would call into question my authenticity.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Heiro: what were your last words?</div>

<div>- Rotrude: how i felt your parents' life of fishing and religious obligation was sufficient, but i could sense in you a great anger. and then you said "Die----" which i assume was the first syllable</div>

<div>- Heiro: yes, i was going to say "Dining out with you later "</div>

<div>- Rotrude: dining out? you have been captured by the urban civilization that lives outside of our walls.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Heiro: what, in the last five minutes?</div>

<div>- Carlos: spiritual devotion doesn't mean much if you're not tempted to dine out sometimes</div>

<div>- Rotrude: yes, in the absence of temptation, we submit ourselves to punishment, through which we may demonstrate our commitment to the divine</div>

<div>- Heiro: so you want a self-flagellation-off?</div>

<div>- Rotrude: yes, and this halfling's whip would do nicely.</div>

<div></div>

<div>## Request a whipping</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Heiro tries to get Fez to whip him. Fez looks back at Rotrude, who looks interested in how it plays out, and is calming a bit: Fez: ok, prep yourself.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: why are you so hairy?</div>

<div>- Heiro: yes, this is evidence i've been living a hard life out here. it's not like it is in the cloisters. as they say, you have to "grow some hair on your bottom"</div>

<div>- Carlos: also ... a tree cast a spell on us</div>

<div>- Rotrude: probably you just haven't chafed off the hair from walking extensively as you should be doing. in the absence of that, your friend must whip it off you.</div>

<div>- Heiro: ok, but then you have to whip yourself harder!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: This is our way!</div>

<div></div>

<div>## A simple crown</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Laceleaf: to fez: I'm gonna have to make sure you come back with me to take care of your folks. Just lemme put this little circlet on your head (Crown of Madness but reflavored).&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Heiro puts it together that this reddish-gold metal matches the description of the metal deposit that the archaeologists were telling you about.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- The crown dissolves over Fez's head.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Laceleaf: I know you're not one for ornamentation, but that crown was gonna help you figure out what to do in life.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: I'm not one for a heavy head.</div>

<div>- `Laceleaf: It's grief and your subconscious regret that give you a heavy head!`</div>

<div>- Carlos: All this extra hair is heavy enough.</div>

<div>- Carlos gets in touch with Aulë, who tells him it's ok to kill the undead.</div>

<div> - Nothing against old people, but we're against the undead.</div>

<div> - invokes Turn Undead and undead turn to begin running, as the ducttape on Carlos's spiritual hammer shines like burnished silver which expands in a spiral and frightens the undead with holy light.</div>

<div>- Rotrude brags about how hurt she is and then disappears down the stairs.</div>

<div>- Heiro: Disappear like you always do!</div>

<div>- Rotrude: I have always been there for you, Heironymus. I have taught you much of what you know. You were very precocious.</div>

<div>- Heiro: I already knew that! I just enjoyed spending time with your pet lizards. I mean leeches.</div>

<div>- Carlos: I had a pet leech.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: What kind of leech?</div>

<div>- Carlos: I liked catching worms to keep as pets in the ponds outside the cave. I brought back a leech and then minnows ate it.</div>

<div>- Rotrude: have you been traumatized?</div>

<div>- Carlos: I think so?</div>

<div>- Rotrude: yes, Heiro, you were heartbroken when my lizards died until i got replacements for them.</div>

<div>- Heiro: I still have them ?!</div>

<div>- `&nbsp;…???`</div>

<div>- Carlos: hey amalia, you're running away, do you understand what's happening?</div>

<div>- Amalia: You're emitting some kind of evil energy, and the closer i try to get the more it hurts me.</div>

<div>- Carlos: All i did was cast a spell that affects undead.</div>

<div>- Amalia: Oh, one of your clerical spells?</div>

<div>- Carlos: Yes ... although I'm not sure it was worth it. But it implies you might be dead.</div>

<div>- Amalia: Yes, I needed help supporting a beam, and you stepped away for a moment, and ... then you pulled me out of this rubble. Do you just want to put distance between us, to break up?</div>

<div>- Carlos: I only cast it as a test</div>

<div>- Amalia: You're already testing the relationship!</div>

<div>- Carlos: Well I do see myself as a scientist. Medicine occupies the middle ground between science and religion.</div>

<div>- Amalia: Yes, Aulë was very close-minded about who you could spend time with.</div>

<div>- Carlos: Drav, did you ever kill someone by accident? Why isn't there one of these things for you?</div>

<div>- Fez: Drav doesn't like letters (see: correspondent)</div>

<div>- Drav doesn't recall -- it's a little hard to remember things.</div>

<div>- You're all _pretty_ sure you're remembering real things.</div>

<div>- Drav: Can we check to see if there's something altering our mental states.</div>

<div>- Fez: I'm pretty sure I didn't kill laceleaf.</div>

<div>- Carlos: I feel really guilty. I don't like it. I want it to be spread around.</div>

<div>- Fez: I'm just supposed to feel guilty about abandoning my family.</div>

<div>- Heiro: I definitely killed that lady. But in my defense she was being really annoying in bringing up my parents.</div>

<div>- Rotrude (from below): Heiro, YOU started that conversation.</div>

<div>- Carlos: can we address the rock face on the floor?</div>

<div>- [Drav and Carlos attempt to communicate with Xanthu]</div>

<div>- XANTHU: these creatures are of your acquaintance. It's difficult even for me to tell what's pulled from your psychic fingerprints and what is "real"</div>

<div>- Drav: Why did you say we would help you? Have these creatures appeared to others?</div>

<div>- Xanthu: I have used this technique before. But what I referred to was the death of the Queen of the Sun -- i do not need you to be impressed; i don't need the approval of mortals;&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Carlos: what do you need from us?</div>

<div>- Drav: Why did you call out to us?</div>

<div>- Xanthu: It's what I see as one of the fundamental breaches [impediments] between you and a fundamental understanding of yourself. I need you to revitalize the empire that was here.&nbsp;</div>

<div> - the kobolds would be useful as sacrifices. they were unable to establish a working relationship with the guardians before angering them.</div>

<div>- Xanthu: well i can't do anything further until you synthesize these threats [either prove yourselves strong enough here, or … fail.]</div>

<div>- Drav: what about me? i don't have anyone to synthesize.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Xanthu: I don't always specifically create these counterparts. There must be something here for you too. Or maybe you're already perfect. (chuckles)</div>

<div>- Hiero, covered in soot and rubble, attempts to convince Xanthu that he is a rock monster. (Interestingly, he fails to use Xanthu's name: one of the many reasons it could be said that he failed to convince the god.) "Basement floor! Ooooooh! It is I, Terence, your baby brother, who you allowed to drink mead at 10 years old, and fell off a parapet to my death! Woooooooooooooooooo!"</div>

<div>- Terence, is that you! Come towards my eyes so that I may see you!</div>

<div>- Heiro trips on a rocky outcropping on the floor and goes sprawling into where the mouth concavity was.</div>

<div>- Drav casts obsidian shards on Laceleaf.</div>

<div>- Laceleaf's eyes burn bright red, "If I'm gonna hurt, you're gonna hurt too"</div>

<div> - Drav gets Hellish-Rebuked. red flames with burning white core.</div>

<div>- Amalia: Carlos, are you just trying to punish me for a relationship peccadillo ?</div>

<div> - Carlos: it's just the circumstances! i don't think we can hang out anymore. i'm not even sure you're who you think you are. this rock demi-god</div>

<div>- Amalia: do you mean Melkaro, the dwarven god?</div>

<div>- Carlos: no, it's some other weird thing.</div>

<div>- Amalia: Well we should take you to a healer, you're so confused. Come with me so I can take care of you.</div>

<div>- Carlos: I ...</div>

<div>- Amalia: I have no doubt you'll act independently, going off to pray to Aulë, rubbing your hammer.</div>

<div>- Amalia: Don't even think about coming near me; I'll slit your throat.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez: prefers to just kill or just talk. So he attacks Laceleaf.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- [Laceleaf criticizes Fez's whip and Hellish Rebukes him. And then gets confused with metaphors. "coming back by not going back" -- Laceleaf is bad at telling stories and prefers partying.]</div>

<div>- [Fez tries to convince her she's undead. Laceleaf learned how to throw fire being close to Moradin's forge in Torffeton, having volcanic power running through our bones]</div>

<div>- Hieronymus: Ki-fueled strike. Dagger &amp; unarmed strike.</div>

<div> - Laceleaf: who's this gross piece of shit? and starts shading Hiero.</div>

<div>- Laceleaf pulls out a 3 foot long bowie knife as Hiero runs away, wrenches a shield from one of the dead kobold's hands, pulling off the hand, and shouting ... something .&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Laceleaf licks the scimitar, spreading a greenish-white saliva over the blade. Fez tries not to think about it, but is pretty convinced she covered it in poison.</div>

<div> - [Ability: Saliva trick]</div>

<div>- "Your wiley friend there distracted me"</div>

<div>- Carlos attacks Laceleaf with his warhammer and conjures his spiritual weapon.</div>

<div>- Fez attacks with divine smite attacks Laceleaf, who belittles his whip and Hellish Rebukes.</div>

<div> - "I hope you burn to death just like my parents froze to death"</div>

<div> - "The earth was our class, and geometry was our professor, so I know all there is to know"</div>

<div>- also if you lose a cousin, you also have to discount a cousin you do have</div>

<div>- "What is the lungs but two holes that don't go nowhere?"</div>

<div>- Fez: Halflings can never turn down a dare to eat</div>

<div>- [They start getting in on education and existentialism]</div>

<div>- Heiro tosses Carlos a poison since Carlos wanted to see if Laceleaf could eat anything.</div>

<div> - He runs behind her, mixes bat guano and sulfur in his mouth, and dips finger in bile lighter fluid and fireballs her.</div>

<div> - He thus starts coronavirus</div>

<div>- Laceleaf takes damage from fireball but almost gets out of the way.&nbsp;</div>

<div> - I have beautiful hair, thank you very much, you can't see it because of the chain mail hood I'm wearing.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Laceleaf trashes Fez with her bowie knife and wrathful smite. "Maybe I'll even embrace this warm fighting"</div>

<div>- Drav spontaneously passes out.</div>

<div>- Back up to Fez -&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Then Hiero does faerie fire with remainder of mouth fire, but Laceleaf avoids it because it was too weak, "looks like you're too weak to even spit right"</div>

<div>- Laceleaf murders out cold Fez, grabs him by the ankle, and starts walking towards the stairs, leaving Rotrude's leeches behind. Fez's blood is too coagulated for the leeches to get in.</div>

<div> - and Fez was always taught to keep your mouth closed when you fall unconscious</div>

<div>- Carlos Preserve Life's Fez.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Fez trips Laceleaf who falls on her own sword and dissolves into a greenish-white puddle of salivary "gluids".</div>

<div></div>
