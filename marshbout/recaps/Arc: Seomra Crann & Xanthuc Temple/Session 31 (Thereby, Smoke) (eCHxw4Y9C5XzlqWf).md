<div>- Shoemaker dumps a double-handful of goodberries onto the ground, walks to the nearest table and puts the vase full of earth there.</div>

<div>- Meanwhile, Flick is rolling around on the ground, trying to put out a fire.</div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I thought that, being a wood-elf, you would have been circumspect enough to look around for the source of your magic. You just thought it was coming to you from nowhere in particular?</div>

<div>- Flick: I don’t know what you want me to say; that’s kind of how magic works.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Well maybe for wizards, but not for plane-walkers like you. You’re going to have to reconcile yourself to this.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- (As Shoemaker has a hard time getting both Flick and Fez in the circumference of the vase's effect) Flick: my flailing around has paid off!</div>

<div></div>

<div>- The jar of earth starts to tremble and soil spills over the top, down the table, and starts to engulf Shoemaker. She dissolves into a hilly lump of flesh. Resonating out of the jar: &lt;&lt;Return to what you are&gt;&gt; Fez for a moment feels himself start to collapse into a fleshmound, but he shakes his head and steels himself and the vision disappears.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- (Flick remembers that Onfalon told her a long time ago that Shoemaker had spirits in her basement which people came to pray to.)</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc goes to stab Shoemaker.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: why are you going after me? My concern is with this spoiled ranger who keeps grabbing things as if from a void.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: as weird as they are, these people are my friends.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: So you’re a little thief too?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: Little? I’d like to think I'm 'medium' to 'renowned'.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Are we talking about height or notoriety?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: Why not both?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: why does it always have to be about height?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc: semantically arguing with a demon-bear is not one of the things I imagined doing.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: your extra-little cleric friend over here could tell you that.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: she’s talking about Carlos.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Yeah, the dwarf. Compared to you, Fez, he’s a giant. With that robe, it’s hard to tell gender, in case I used the wrong one right there.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: You’ve been backpedalling like this since you got here.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: TBH this isn’t my natural habitat. I’m used to the woods.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: You still have to be better.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I do my best. What are you saying I don’t do well enough? You all are the ones with privilege. Ganging up on me in a dungeon. This feels like a zoo enclosure.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: YOU came in HERE. … This is going to get GRIZZLY.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I’m not a black, polar, or grizzly bear. Are you another cleric? You don’t appear to have a deity you dedicate yourself to?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: That’s a solid maybe. But this fight is going to be a LOSS for you. You came to talk about goodberries, but we’re going to say goodbye. Also you’re a metaphysical construct that doesn’t exist outside this dungeon.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Aren’t we all? When before have you disappeared into an ineluctable dungeon with the face of a god on the floor.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hieronymus takes a flying leap onto Shoemaker’s back and attacks with his Karbunqle staff. He smashes his hand against the kettle-pot after smashing her over the head with his staff. Hieronymus skips out of there, but Shoemaker catches him in the heel with her greataxe.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: So many of you are in robes. It’s hard to tell with the body ends and the robe starts. I don’t wear clothes so it’s difficult to figure out the geometry.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hieronymus: I plan on wearing your pelt when we kill you.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Be careful my pelt doesn’t wear … you … after you put it on.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hieronymus: Well I’ve always wanted a good hair-shirt.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Definitely don’t take my helmet! It’s just here for decoration. And it even looks stupid!</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick [Insight 18] Shoemaker doesn’t want you to take the helmet.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc continues to debate what kind of 12-dimensional kettlepot bear chess Shoemaker is playing.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick intuits that this helmet has something to do with the fire suppression compulsion, and her ability to invoke the soil spirit.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez knows that the helmet needs to come off. For no reason.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: “Since the dawn of time, bears have not worn helmets on their heads.”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez remembers Ponderous bears, Lugubrious bears, (halflings consider themselves so entertaining that other entities that couldn’t speak common were considered boring); Insipid bears (all from childhood books about bears)</div>

<div></div>

<div> - it is speaking to you, and with the accent of the lead singer of a band, so as a halfling you might even feel a little affiliation with them.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Drav shoots a ray of frost that misses Shoemaker, but adorns the vat of earth with some frosty tips.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: Will it take us to Flavortown? [investigation explosion of 2]: Flavortown will commence shortly.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div> - the raw smell of city earth when construction crews have dug up a sub basement.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick has “put out the fire”, nor is she obsessed with kindling. Flick remembers knocking over Drav and shouting at her&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick [perception 16] can tell there is something odd about the active radius around the vat of earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez is slightly spacey to start with, thinking about how clever he is most of the time; he might have sneezed at the melty-flesh vision.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick avoids using planar warrior; throws a hunters mark at Shoemaker. “You made a mistake that’s just the first in a long line of mistakes!”&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I’m here as a warning to you! (Flick shoots her twice; nocks a third arrow)</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: “You can fuck off, or we can keep doing this.”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I don’t know why you’re so resistant to being helped, as far as your only true powers are concerned.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick narrows her eyes.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker turns to Fez: And what did YOU just say? (presumably about flavor town). Frazzled by Flick’s arrows, she’s unable to swing her axe properly. However, she’s close enough to the vase to shake it like a delicate maraca in Fez’s direction. Closer to the epicenter, Fez feels his body start to come unglued, and then snaps back into stability.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc successfully puts together a Snav Snifter (red dragon burp, gremlo’s indigestion? gremlo’s heartburn? bigby’s “i ate too many spicy wings [spicy wings are angel wings torn off in hell and eaten by demons]”), which he finishes and shouts: “Fez, get out of the way!”&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: when you say “Watch out” i can hear that too.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez attacks with whip, hits, runs and hops up on the bar.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: “when i’m not rolling around …”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: “Oh yeah, why don’t you feel a bit warm right now?”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: “No, as a wood elf I know when things are on fire. and i’m not on fire in the middle of a damp dungeon underground.”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: Haven’t you ever heard of coal-mine fires? In any case, you should still feel guilt about the way you abuse your magic.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: I’m gonna take all your Goodberries after we explode your corpse.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: There’s not a finite supply.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: Then why are you mad about it?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: because you open yourself up to retaliation each time you grab one from elsewhere. You don’t remain safe when you use your portal spells. — no snappy retort, eh?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hieronymus does what he thinks is whisper telepathically to his friends. “Guys, I know this bear’s weakness. If I take her kettle off, her brains will be exposed underneath.” — He takes out his bagpipes and thinks back to the first song he learned in the monastery: the bare bear-plains national anthem. (which is the only song he can play). there’s a heavily orchestrated version ; but hieronymus is playing the hot cross buns learner’s version. he starts to play and looks over to see if Shoemaker is reacting in any way, like taking her helmet off (out of respect)&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- He plays really terribly but realizes that no one else can hear his telepathy; it might be that tapping into the whisper walls is using all his telepathic energy, or nobody heard him (not getting service down here). but he still thinks he’s telepathic. He plays so badly that it angers Shoemaker.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: this is like the sounds of the elks mating in the winter. which i hate. everything else mating, though, i love.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude (shouting) : did i hear that it was damp up there? it is quite wet down here as well; we should consider uniting the spaces in an aquatic park of entertainment. and murder.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: I would love send you to sea world.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: to see which world?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: the world in which you don’t exist.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: I feel like that is a logical contradiction. yes they never did teach you logic at the monastery, did they? that’s reserved for those 200 years old or older.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: but i’m like… at least 300.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: I thought I was at least 300. But … then why didn’t you ever take logic classes?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: oh that’s right, because we’re twins.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: Yes, indeed, we are born of the same mother</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: yes, like all elves at the monastery. don’t you remember when we all hatched at the same time?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: of course; elves hatch from eggs. you made sure you use my hypertrophied fingernails and toenails to chip open the egg for yourself. it’s where my obsession with manicures comes from. i never want to be instrumentalized again. but you have no problem instrumentalizing others.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: i seem to be having a bit of a problem with my instrument. once it’s fixed … things are going to go down.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: did i hear the bare bear-plain national anthem?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: i was, yes</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: i must tell you that the bears have overthrown their nationalist ambitions, and since have joined together as a consensus-based democracy of bears.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: well if you know so much, why don’t you come up here and play it yourself?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: is that an invitation which aims to dispel the fact that i have been turned from the doughty cleric up there?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: yeah, it’s like … a detente.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: Ok well i will see you shortly.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: i definitely can wait, because i hate you.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: did someone say Snav? he’s well-known around here.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick thinks back to Joan, and wonders if she made it back to Marshbout or Cressida.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Drav (Angela has left; through Ian) casts … ? fire bolt.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker, a fire-retardant creature, only takes 1/2 damage. -- Perhaps on a ponderous bear that might have worked, but some of us spend our entire lives putting out fires in the woods.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Eldar goes to re-tag Drav to start the game up again, doing a bunch of damage. "Drav, don’t you remember? we were never supposed to tell your new parents about me. I was one of the reasons that you were forced out of your birth home. doesn’t this ring a bell?"</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick reaches out and envelops Shoemaker in an energy field, and tries to explode it in a point. for damage.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div> - retreats out to table, and then tries a called shot to try to knock the kettle off her head.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- The kettle falls off Shoemaker’s head and clangs against the floor.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I gave you a lot to think about, eh?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez, standing on the bar, gets his legs cut out from under him as Shoemaker rushes up with her great axe.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I’m too tired to go back and get my helmet. unrelated, my ass, with its callouses, is the toughest part of my body.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc repositions himself and throws a Snav’s Snifter, which explodes on Shoemaker. Jean-Luc sprints over and picks up the kettle. “Got your stupid helmet motherfucker!”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: you’re right — so you should just leave it where it is. if you’re carrying something stupid that makes you a stupid.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc [intimidation 15] (“what’s the equivalent of giving the bear the middle finger?”) attempts to goad Shoemaker</div>

<div></div>

<div> - Shoemaker: “I wouldn’t put that on if I were you; but i’m gonna be over there in a second anyway and there’s not much you can do about it”. Jean-Luc pantomimes huge jaw hands like “blah blah blah”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-Luc hears behind him the soft sifting noise of dirt behind him; the vase is erupting with soil and covers his boots and climbs up his body in a mound. he turns into a creature of pure physical flesh; a gelatinous pyramid; as the dirt recedes ; (from the outside he looks normal).&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div> - afraid for at least 1 minute with a DC 17 Charisma throw.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez heals himself.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: I bet you too think that ability to heal yourself comes from nowhere?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: pass. you’re talking nonsense.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: i wanted to have a sophisticated conversation about your belief system. — shoemaker bites Fez, and he doesn’t slip on goo. but her saliva looks like normal saliva, not marjorie’s greenish-white saliva.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: i want to play one of my favorite bear games. i killed a bear when i was only 3. and he takes out darts to shoot them.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: hieronymus, i knew you were a murderer: you’ve been killing bears and bars and elves. and fish.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: well obviously i didn’t kill a bear when i was three; i was still in the egg-womb with you.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: I was under the impression we counted ages after we hatched. i would rather not have to think about abortions, which are an egg-layer’s right to choose.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: not in Marshbout it’s not.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude (getting frazzled for some reason): well — marshbout is a large place — and — has a diversity of opinions (perhaps she’s been wrestling with her pro-choice views after growing up as a monk)</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: we can talk politics later. i’m not exactly sure where you are at the moment.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: i’m downstairs; i was just speaking with Eldar. a very very powerful little lady. i’m not sure you know the extent of her hidden powers.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: there is no escape.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: well, i _have_ made my way out of the monastery. or we can see each other in a moment up there?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: no, i have … an appointment.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: oh, and it’s covered? what is it for?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: no, dental is not.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: probably all the rich fatty and sugary urban fare you’ve been eating. if you adhered to the dietary restrictions of the monastery it would just be grasses and natural plants and fruits.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: if you had any sense, you would know that i’m going to get my teeth drilled. because i desire the pain.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: well have you considered dilettantes, because it would be more torturesome?</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: but the professional knows exactly where to poke and prod</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: i suppose the difficulty is when they get so wrapped up in their technique&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: my dentist is a true maniac. he has no scruples whatsoever.</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude. a rare combination indeed. i must offer you all the worst, then.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: if you’ll excuse me, i’m in the middle of a game of darts now</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Rotrude: by all means, throw the darts as hard as you may into your own extremities, as we play darts.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- both of Hiero’s darts hit the bear; — Bear’s eye! and he shoots directly for her eyes.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Shoemaker: sometimes it’s important to see what’s hidden, but this really hurts.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero kills her very slowly. He hops onto her, and presses the darts deeper and deeper into her brain through her eyes. (thinking he’s using time-manipulating magic) -- everyone else sees him shoot the darts, which go into random parts of her body (shoulder and ribs) but Hiero runs up anyway and smashes her eyes with his open palms. “Time-Manipulating Magic!”</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez and Hieronymus [DC 17 charisma check] . Hieronymus also turns into a flesh mound. might actually be one of his dreams as a flagellant, to be nothing but exposed nerves and muscles; unable to move.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Eldar’s creepy whispers to Drav don’t go unnoticed, and Drav shrieks in pain as Eldar reaches out to grab her hand again.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div> - Eldar: If you wouldn’t try to keep me hidden inside of you, I can promise that it wouldn’t be so painful when I emerge. — the putrid rot of drav’s flesh is evident.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Drav disengages and runs back behind Carlos.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick takes the opportunity to shoot at Eldar, this poor little dwarf spirit. Eldar becomes transparent and disappears as she whispers to Drav “don’t allow them to keep suppressed within you what is your greatest power!”&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick tries to shatter the vase with a regular arrow. the arrow pings harmlessly off it, despite its appearing to be made of glass.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Drav: i think it has some kind of magical protection on it. Carlos is my best friend. (Drav and Carlos hug each other). We may need to cast dispel magic on it.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Rotrude shouts: Which one is … “shithead” ?</div>
