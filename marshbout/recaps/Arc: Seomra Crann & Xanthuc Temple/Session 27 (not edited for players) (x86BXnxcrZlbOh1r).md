## recap (separated into own audio file)

- Carlos (Jake) doesn't like the peryton quest (they don't have any leads) - likes the flower folk

    - "we've done a lot for those gnolls already"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Jean-Luc: are we really thinking about not helping the gnolls?


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## depart simurgh's quarters, taken to eth eliothai by the hedge

- brought outside the hegde, another tunnel to go under the ground; the flowers drop into the tunnel to indicate they should go in there.

- drav pushes hieronymus into the hole.

- they still have 2 inches of body hair / double beard length

- H braiding hair to JL's hair - [sleight of hand :4] H still has tonsured bald spot, so braiding elongated side bangs into hair

    <!-- -->

- JL tries to push H. [4]. what should this be? - JL tries to push H: end up on top of each other, rolling into tunnel together, hair slightly intertwined.

    - H: i was a bit askew, but now everything is right as rain
    - response?

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- ended up in cavern, through a slightly open door. see: - female half elf, pricked ears, very pointy (surgery?), deep brown complexion, black hair, center part bob, red riding pants, padded leather riding vest over white tunit.

    - room: dark, but illuminated by red phosphorescent mushrooms lining upper recesses of cavern
    - firepit in cavern she's standing near
    - around edge: bottles and containers holding herbs, spices, and medicines.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- [fez worried about mushrooms] - asks about where they fit into lifecyle

    - prep stuff like this
    - suddenly IN the cavern like whipped there. was it a portal ? felt a little weird.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- "oh the mushrooms - more like the light cycle. i can develop people's fortunes without overexposing them to the radiant light of those who would have them silenced" - fix up

    <!-- -->

- JL: are we still in the hedge?

- EE: you will see no vines or leaves, but i make us of its vital magics

- JL introduces self. - practice gifting instead of hellos

    <!-- -->

- EE: I am a sioroman, of the hedge, i'm able to augur about the future, make predictions, tell people how their lives will go, and how they have gone. - JL: that sounds quite useful.

    <!-- -->

- P: [asks bush for snack]: - plate mushrooms stack out and on top of one is a tasty little tuber

    - p [appropriately comfortaed]

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- EE: please keep requests to a minimum. requests do lessen the total pool

- P: did you get red riding pants from tree?

- EE: they were made for me by a weaver in the hedge. made by the manual abilities of actual peoples. the hedge doesn't typically grow textiles; they have to be sourced from elsewhere.

- H: where is your steed.

- EE: should be tethered up in the main grounds. it sounds like you wouldn't have seen it: it's a magnificent griphon by the name of Chad.

- H: i love it, and our voices. i'm not sure if i'm an elf or a half-elf. i have to do a 23 and me. - response

    <!-- -->

- [regular voice]

- P: is your voice due to black mold? - can the tree outfit you with a leaf if you're naked?

    <!-- -->

- EE: there's nothing wrong with being naked.

- P: some people get self-conscious and uncomfortable. i want to make sure the tree would be sensitive.

- EE: it would accommodate a request but not force a leaf on anyone. - EE: its vegetable products can be used in a number of ways. are you from the classical school of arts where a nude figure must present a rocky fig leaf upon their genitals in order to be considered appropriate

    - P: yes,
    - EE: there are artists in the hedge who would love to take the measure of your knowledge and style.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- EE: only one question, yes! a limited pool of tree magic!

- EE: if your friend hasn't eaten that tuber, it can help me determine the best course of action for us as a group.

- P: I totally ate that! i was hungry and wanted to feel like the tree is still protecting me.

- EE: all of you sit around this fire and hold hands. CHAAAAAD!!! get down here!

- [within a few moments a huge eagle head pokes its way in; flatten its wings fast against it's body; makes the entire cavern tremble as it pushes its way through. it's a griffin. body of a lion, magnificent pelt, the face and wings of an eagle, front legs are those of an eagle.] - [sneezes as it comes in because of the dust and black mold]

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## the vision

- EE: Chad, you may begin! [chad starts flapping wings; forces fire into a tunnel into EE's body] - EE grows to where she has a form with angelic fire wings, fed by the intense flame. flames take at first the form of the peryton; can see clearly: looks like it has the body of an eagle but the head of a stag with gigantic antlers that are dripping with grey velvet; at the tips are intimidating points, and its face is enraged: gaunt and full of writhing forms under the skin; eyes are red and glowing.

    - the image recedes and you see the image of tusternoof: a tree with the face of a deer's skull. after that arises the figure of a heavily muscled man with the head of a bull, but stag's antlers. and he grows more and more enormous until filling the entire cavern, and then the fire goes out.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- EE: Baphomet is the most urgent and exigent threat; taken forms as Peryton and Tusternoof and maybe even flowerfolk.

- JL: can you tell US if we're successful.

- EE: it helps me recognize lines of the greatest application of force -- your best future prospects would be -- i can tell that you' aren;t ready to face the fiend itself; if you were to approach the slubber and get the help of the flower folk and free them from their amber prisons, that would be the strongest way to start

- JL: i've never turned town advice from someone i just met in a weird cave

- EE: i'm too weak to start the fire up again now! -- and the wizard - gradge ? i'm quite good at knowing people's names.

- D: close.

- EE: yes, Gravvs!. -- on your way here you may have seen the temples of Xanthuc -- going into those, if you do you must be careful; they've also become a site for Baphomet's followers, but may give you a lead on how to approach exiling them from this area.

- P asks for one last tuber. once on the surface. [Perception: - basket of potatoes in front of you in intricately woven wicker basket.] P gives hedge a hug. - you feel its vines feeling you anxiously on your back in a perfunctory manner.

- [INT check] - they don't notice … anything weird about wicker basket ? - should have something other than 'nothing happens'

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## (back-up) to talk to field workers

- Beluar and Kenduel.

- large space, about 20 people

- engaged in various aspects of archeological investigation. blueprints set out on makeshift tables. people taught the arts of excavating a site; shown how to delicately brush artifacts or mark out squares and grids. two figures talking who look like people are treating them as though they know the most. - (told about them by Lovesea and Lafarelle)

    <!-- -->

- Drav introduces self.

- Beluar (She): hello! - really got to practice gifting-- instead of 'such an intimidating way about you'

    - uniquely tall elf in tailored blue vest and jodpurs.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav: parents taught me to stand my ground around the big people.

- B: i wish i had the strength you do. - mostly we look for old ruins from some of the vanished kingdoms from around here. lately we've been exploring some of the power points -- unfortunately named, i know -- that arose during the banishment of tantegorisch.

    <!-- -->

- Drav: very interesting work. ! i met Lovesea and Lafarelle and they mentioned the work you were doing here.

- B: yes we rely on a lot of the intellectual work they do in order to find the right places to dig and interpret our findings. we rarely get back in touch with them as often as we should.

- i should have had a question here for her instead of dropping off at the end of the answer

- B: we've discovered a few interesting things. we have a technical name for the points: Char Aknh; Varg Ankh, it depends which nomenclautre you like: refers to the four points. - we don't didg under Seomra ; we've done a lot of work out to the west in new deposit of strange metals; red-gold metals that are new to the area. would have pursued that, except there were some lizardfolk who came in and -- they were able to push us off the site, and we'd love to reclaim the site for its intellectual potential; but lizardfolk what can you do they came up from the marsh.

    <!-- -->

- [brings up a map] -- right where the nephil foothills come in and meet the mountains.

- i should have had more interesting artifacts to show - we did try to get in touch with the town right near there (deesuhl nook cove?) and they wereen't ready to tussle with the lizardfolk. they are quite well protected.

    - some interesting work on the slubber on the amber ghost crystals down there.
    - Drav: we were going there soon. what did you find?

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- B: caution: we did see some (prejudiced?) cultists lurking around the area, started embedding themselves in the tip. quite frightening, and they didn't harm us, but they could barely limp themselves to their next destination. the crystals are interesting. formations that FF live within -- symbiosis with the FF trees to create microenvironments.

- Drav: you've discovered a lot.

- B: we've had 10 years knowing that this was becoming a more detectable pheonmenon. we didn't know anything for the first 15 after the banishment. - should be careful in touching the crystals: the crystals in there before the FF , but it's possible for them to invade a defenseless body; we're not sure it's harmful but it can happen. i'd look for the mediation of the FF.

    - you may even see a few of our number down there. a braver few. a human in the area: Arlan Lubbock. he's a cartographer from further NE, and he came down in particular to study this. and Mogesh, one of the ancient earth spirits under there.
    - he'd love to talk to visitors; and likes to keep secret a pocket mansion. puts off appearance of living humbly.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H: this is some excavation you have here. i dabble in digging myself. i was curious -- have you ever come across an ancient book containing a spell that would open a portal to … another world of some kind? - B: if we found that it would be first on our list to give some of the theorists. i'm not sure we would keep it down here.

    <!-- -->

- H: if you do --- best to give it to a museum or an official institution.

- B: sure, official institution can be dangerous too.

- H walks around nodding at items

- \[Perception check] [2]: a bunch of nonsense that makes no sense - do see a book with a circle embossed on the front, edges of the circle have little energy waves or something coming off it, bound in black leather.

    <!-- -->

- H: probably not a portal book! [Sleight of hand 15]: Beluar doesn't seem to notice. - pats B on shoulder: keep up the good work.

    <!-- -->

- B (should have asked for donation?)

- she looks at Fez, and is holding three urns: - we did find these, not in the typical way, but Seomra gave them to me and told me to present them to present them to a certain maritime halfling, and these … leaf boots

    - remains of quickling bodies i should have come up with cooler vessel type things
    - boots of speed
    - "get down, turn around, go to town, bee boop scooby": "heel toe dosie come come on babie let's go"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Fez takes them with great care. secures them in his pack to return. - should i have had him make a religion check? for morals ?

    <!-- -->

- Beluar to Drav : is this something you could use? (pieces of slate that had perforations and tied together with rope to use as a chalkboard) -- can pick one extra evocation spell for each level you have as a wizard. would this help us or you ? - drav slips them a little pouch of the leaf ground by her parents. what the fuck is drav talking about.

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

## approaching the Xanthuc temple mounds

- pass through forests and beautiful bodies of water, proceeding south-south-west, with flick so they don't get lost

- pyramidal in shape; aligned east-west almost exactly.

- the one on the east (their left) the facade is made out of bones. smoke coming out.

- the one on the west; facade made of wood; there is a similar hole in it, pointing towards the bone facade.

- between them is a 1/4 mile plain that looks like a the nevada salt plains.

- as you walk towards, don't see any activity.

- H: no matter how far we are, i race as far as I can towards the bones one.

    - mounds themselves made out of packed earth

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- are there worms?\~!?!?!?!?! i should put in some worms.

- Drav things something is heraldric symbol of half-orc kingdom where ruler was known as Gar Hrothgar (which is a real historical kingdom)

- Paros knows that it's Baphomet.

    - are they asking about … the fire vision of EE. ? yes -- the angle of the 3d shape

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H has run ahead, so has 1 level of exhaustion.

- Paros to Carlos: who sucks at religion now! (suck my critical, Carlos) (now everyone can tell how smart I am about religion!)

    - Carlos chooses not to respond. [RELIGION 17] praised by Aulë for having admirable restraint.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H calls out to Carlos: GREAT JOB!!

- Carlos sees very faintly your original spirit hammer re-knights you.

- duck tape: tape make out of duck saliva.

- H: reaches the window, wiping tears from eyes, dives through the window. [18 athletics].

    - jumps through the window in a tight tuck and pop up on your feet. the smell of burning flesh assails your nostrils. suspended from the ceiling (the entire interior is made of stone) rotating on ropes are wicker baskets. Dripping with blood; entrails are overflowing them. somehow smoldering despite how wet they are. floor spattered with entrails and flesh underneath the baskets. interspersed with the baskets are huge cuts of meat from exotic megafauna; gigantic ribcages are smoking; under the cuts of meat there are groups of wood chips burning to smoke the meat.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H: sounded like Bison meat.

- Drav: 'human' was also mentioned.

    - Lots of things crossed with eagles.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- I should bring eagles in somehow -- as the subjects of experiments

- EE mentioned there was something that could help us here.

- Jake: I almost thought we would get a sidekick.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### in the temple

- While H is looking around, the rest of you manage to get to the edge of the temple.

- H: everyone, come in! it's glorious in here!

- [all go in except JL] - H: it's like your favorite, legends of the hidden temple? JL: the one about the giant stone golem? yes, loved it. - H: the wonderful temple that was full of meat, everywhere you looked.

    ```
    <!-- -->
    ```

    <!-- -->

- JL: does the smell reach out here? (yes)

- I should have given more details about smell ; i should have offered insight on galen's statements

- JL reluctantly walks into the temple; hoists himself in through window. - new ability called SANITY. [15] -- pretty sane

    - \[SAN check: failure]: the sight of all this, it brings you back to something that you'd blocked out of your mind that happened with a gang you were with; you feel like you remember opening a door and seeing something like this in the room opposite. couldn't tell if it was a butchery or site of torture. door slammed in your face, and one of the criminals screamed that you shouldn't be in that area. (disadv. on ability checks until takes damage / or 10 minutes)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- 1:05:03:914

- H rolling around in blood and meat and entrails and throwing it into the air joyfully. picks up a good sized hunk and shoves it into JL's face: "welcome to meat world you son of a bitch - should have asked: how does this fit into H's character?

    <!-- -->

- Paros is hungry again. jumps up for one of the baskets. gets so much hangtie that he can untie the basket and bring it down with him. - medicine check to identify what's in the basket: [high]. went bad before it started cooking. made up of a variety of humanoid species.

    <!-- -->

- Paros: I miss the tree! it never gave me this kind of crap.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### noises

- Carlos hears noises that are coming from what seem like a passage underground. - shouts: "Who goes there?"

    - noises stop

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: who had a BBQ and didn't invite us. the meat that's smoking is edible. doesn't look humanoid.

- they all get ready in some way

- Carlos gets closer and prepares hammer when noises continue not to be there - stone in the corner that can be depressed to open the main passageway.

    - presses foot down, sees strange glyph, takes 14 points of thunder damage that rockets her up and away.
    - been 10 minutes, so don't hear anything from behind stone. glyph probably has to be cast again to work. but definitely let people know about their presence.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- practice cleaning up this description and learn about traps

- the magical mechanism is broken; have to lift the stone manually. - all manage to lift it after about 10 minutes.

    <!-- -->

- see stones that go deep underground

- Carlos detects fiends, "FIEND!" -- gets some echoes back

- figure out how to pick up when nothing happening

- H gathers meat up under chin

- in the tunnel, smells musty, although the walls are made out of stone, but there are thick vines growing through the stones at points.

- Paros requests a snack: nothing happens - i should have had him do a perception check for … snacks?

    <!-- -->

- best case is that they have 1/2 an hour.

- 1/4 mile towards the other mound - area ahead where vines not as thick; stone not buckled by vines.

    <!-- -->

- i should really speed this up

- DK: any markings on walls? you can see some ancient symbols, further down, closer to the floor; at one time the tunnel was taller (or, the floor was lower) - H knowledge of ancient history. [11] drav [bad?] [23 for someone?]

    - "looks bizarre" - doesn't accord with linguistic laws, a bunch of swirls and sharp points;
    - doesn't match a historical language you know
    - there is order to the markings; there's a regularity to them.
    - JL makes an rubbing of them.
    - drav has 1st level spell to comprehend languages.
    - H makes sketch of JL while JL is sketching.. H falls asleep and Drav drags hieronymus. Performance [21] to see what lullaby sounds like.
    - H brought to mind of sounds that permeated ears when Roxfallana was turned into the mule. attended by otherworldly music and the lullaby sounds like that. H lulled to sleep.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- another set of stairs that leads upwards. to the other mound.

- still not sure when to give people a forking point or just narrate them getting somewhere without a problem. (i guess -- if I don't have anything planned, then don't give them a choice)

- Perception check -- still learning when to do these.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### in the room

- Paros sees a figure that bears an uncanny resemblance to Isabella, the half-oni - (i think i reveal this a little early) -- i probably should have let him know about the kobolds hiding around there

    <!-- -->

- post a genealogy tree

- phony pony gibroni

- Drav: … eating humans?

- she was trying to help him battle his urges to eat humanoids; getting worse within last 10 years, esp last 6 months

- establish things that happened actually around these dates - Paros feeling a buried animosity to the creature. almost like a primordial hatred for it. (feels like dwarves and elves kind of thing) -- try to keep it under control.

    <!-- -->

- chamber: Throne, that oni is behind, placing hands on back of chair, looking out - 6 columns of opaque luminescent material; silvery-white, -- reach from floor to ceiling (30 feet high) ,

    <!-- -->

- [stealth checks] : JL snidely looks at others "don't you sneak around?" "remind me not to take you on a museum heist" - carlos: "we like stones. stomp stomp."

    - Rovine dosen't seem to notice them
    - H starts stomping more with quarterstaff. (contested ATH for drav to pick him up) [Drav: 20 (YES!}]

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: it's in the oni's nature to eat meat, so don't be too judgmental. we're hear to get him back on track. - H pours poison onto meat he's planning on giving to Rovine

    - JL: shouldn't he make a check to see if he knows which poison to give him?

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Rovine is … 12 feet tall? - H sees them looking, "on no, this is … just in case, just in case"

    <!-- -->

- Drav hoists H high enough above ground. H drops quarterstaff so he can put poison on a piece of gross meat. - [ath 16] JL there with fast hands to catch quarterstaff, plus it has the extra viny protrusions.

    <!-- -->

- JL: why are we here ? i don't think a fight should be necessary.

- Paros: we're friends with his sister.

- i was really floundering around here -- i should always be talking if they aren't

- [flick still … outside]

- Paros: "Ahoy, brother of Isabella!"

- H: how about we do a kids-in-a-trenchcoat ? - Carlos hops onto H's shoulders, and H tries to hop onto JL's shoulders.

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### into the chamber for real after retreating

- this Oni, joined by a beefy kobold on the back of a creature with hairy john goodman face, red beady eyes, canine mouth, buffalo body. big hump with a mane. kobold is riding it. (how did it get in there??!)
- paros: is that your BBQ? rovine: yes
- practice: gifting
- so i guess kobold's gods have antlers ??
- kobolds pour out of side chambers

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### rovine

- so long since i've seen isabella

- "yes" have met lupenna a while ago

- rovine :i wish she had more than a "hi"

    - we were intending to rectify my urges work on alternate phrasings

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: they have a lot of cleanup to do.

- i've now resigned myself to eating meat

- i have no interest in eating the FF - not susceptible to a charismatic leader as the Kobolds are

    - need more motivation for this guy than just 'eats humanoids'
    - kobolds shout: "Raxivort!"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: while walking through the tunnel, we detected fiends. is raxivort one of those?

- Rovine: no

- Paros: not in a … critical way

    - systems of classification are useful sometimes

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Rovine: the mounds are the products of a society priding itself on redundancy, and mass production. commodification of structures. interchangeability.

- Kobolds feel it's their duty if they want to see raxivort come to them.

- Rovine: probably once a week

- practice what to tell people about Raxivort when history check failed

- JL: what does R know about the Peryton (I don't think I came back to this)

- H gets them all chanting Raxivort and the one Kobold reaches out for the meat, which H tosses to the corner.

- infantry kobold runs past to deposit at base of nearby column

- column wavers and looks like it's no larger made of marbelline material; of gauze and the vague shape of a figure begins to take form inside

- Paros warns kobolds about poisoned meat.

- need a kobold voice

- rovine: these kobolds won't get along with gnolls: approach the less furry humanoids (why they are leaving you alone for the moment)

- paros: head kobold on hound grabs meat: infantry places it around the next column, and same thing happens.

- H tries to enchant hair to make it prehensile. -- just reaches in with hand.

    - go to reach in with hand - takes 5 bludgeoning damage; feels like reaching into a maelstrom; hand is buffeted out of it. (but can't see this from outside of column)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Paros: H runs a little masochistic

- Paros: what are these columns, tho.

- Rovine: I think they have something to do with Raxivort. I'd never been able to extract it from the Kobolds tho.

- Paros: how are you helping them?

- remember: if i'm going to tell them anyway, don't make them roll

    - R: "maybe we should step aside for a moment"

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- room in the back-left corner. picks up a rock of a couple tons, and hops down.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

### rovine's basement room on the far corner.

- i should have asked: will you follow and not expected it

- well-appointed chamber. overstuffed black leather armchair, study desk, library with innumerable books; rooms further on with a dining room or kitchenette. room for all to stand

- R: a year ago i stopped hearing from my sister. she had connections to hags in the marsh who helped keep my urges at bay. since then she's disappeared. something romantic going on that she wishes the familiy not to know"

    - i can masquerade as raxivort and take the sacrifices. it's actually a vort god; through some intercommunication they've taken up with the Raxivort. it's been a long time since dragons have been seen hereabouts.
    - i eat the meat and perform the duties of Raxivort. i assign favoritism to certain members, and disappear. my ability to appear and reappear arbitrarily gives weight to the arbitrainess of their situation.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- so how explain that he's rovine

- Paros: why would isabella not come to visit. couldn't she vacation with the person she's having a relationship with?

- R: what she's doing involves some level of deception; it's hard to escape using our ability to shapeshift; she may not want any element of deception to be revealed to a lover. i don't know; she's complicated.

    - paros: well she's only been out of acting as Lupenna for a week.
    - Rovine: well she could get away for a day.
    - paros: it seems like she's needed to defend the castle.
    - rovine: only in the last year has she stopped visiting me.
    - Paros: well she did seem like she cares about you a lot.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H: what you are doing is reprehensible. when i grew up with my poor fisherman family all we had was religion. for you to use religion to take advantage of these kobolds for your own malign purposes; it's despicable. and i commend you for what you've done. (Jake: it sounded like a carlos speech)

    - i should have had a persuasion check
    - you're welcome to the gamey meat in the smokehouse / sacrifitorium

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- R: that you are able to feel love so readily is a wonder and a blessing

    - it's been some time since i've been able to feel the pull of intense love

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H: I love you as the god that you are portraying. as a giant, you seem ok. i will gladly join in the worship of the great raxivort.

- R: don't get in with Raxivort. he's a charlatan, he's barely a god; derives his powers from some loophole

    - unless you believe in the anarchy and meaninglessness of the universe

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- H: do vorts have anything to do with vortexes?

- Rovine: I'm not sure … no ?

    - "let me cast my thoughts back into my memory" -- indication that his memory is fucked up
    - when i bestow my favor on a vort, it becomes a warlock, even if i act in stead,-- it acquires abilities such as teleportation. they are always on a hunt to reconnect with Raxivort; so the ability to create exploratory portals is part of their religion.
