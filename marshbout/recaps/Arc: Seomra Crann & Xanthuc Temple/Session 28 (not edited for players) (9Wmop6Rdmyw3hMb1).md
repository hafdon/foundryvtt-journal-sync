[I don't think I made one]

# Transcript

rovine: this sounds like a bit of a new development to me. perhaps the columns have responded to H’s attempts to drench them in blood.

hieronymus: that’s the power of hope name for their radiant fizzing more things to hide behind; or levels, because of jean-luc and flick how does murphy transition from character voice to narration voice

to “have a klank-off”

slugg is female with shortbow

look up where people with armor usually got hit allow to make insight on angel when i prep, assume they are going to be rolling insight on everyone or reading their minds and things like “what do i see out here” types of cover things to say while i’m clicking around

downdraft? should have had angel edge flick () more for jenny — i’ not sure what draws her in let the kobolds bravery actions speak for itself should have had physical description of scepter. (i was going to tie its various functions into their improvement) ways that Rovine would actually talk about their adventuring party, and why isabella told flick about tantegorisch?

- Carlos follows drav down the passageway and readies an action to cast Calm Emotions if anyone notices Carlos and approaches.

- Hier is around the throne, which has started pulsating, and giving off a faint heat. He holds a cube of bouillon (a mixture of entrails and offal) over the throne at the end of his thorny quarterstaff like a marshmallow over a fire to try to heat the meat mass and lure the angel towards the sacrificial viscera with the smell.

- Flick watches a bead of blood dripping out of the cube; it makes contact with the throne’s seat,

- Magnificent spectacle; beautiful queen with gold crown and jewelry, has a scepter and a greataxe

- Queen: Who dares to intrude on the temples? Out with you all, or you will be killed! and makes to slash at Hier with the greataxe.

- Hier: You mean everyone … but me, right? [Persuasion 9]

- Queen: I could grant you immunity, as you {{brought me into existence}}, but no you are an intruder, and have merely taken the sacred entrails and brought them here, where they can revive {us}.

- Hier [WIS 17]: Taken by a vision of the Queen as the full summer sun at the sky’s zenith, heat waves pushing you further and further into the ground with each effulgent pulse, and the approaching eclipse that would have blocked off all sunlight forever. He backs up a step or two as he regains his composure.

- Jean-luc examines the scepter. [HISTORY 11]. The Queen resembles certain harvest deities; the scepter allows her to choose between the specific role she is adopting, or which aspect or facet of her being she’s prioritizing. He nocks an arrow and waits for a target.

- Flick arrests the progress of Rovine as the latter inches his way along the wall, presumably making for the open exit. Before getting a word in edgewise Rovine evinced surprise at the appearance of the hitherto unrevealed elf and the strenght of her bosky mephitis. - Do you know Isabella? to which the oni asked in turn for any more insight on the intentions of his sister, and

    - What connection do you have to this temple? to which: I am here by happenstance after the kobolds recently came upon it as an attractive site for their sacrificial rites.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick: If i let you escape without revealing your position to the Queen, could we meet up later and chat about Tantegorisch and defending myself against him?

- Rovine: You certainly wouldn’t be “letting” me. I’d be leaving … strategically … on my own.

- Flick: So you wouldn’t mind if I try to get her attention? (and makes to call over to her) {{Should have allowed an INTIMIDATION check here}}

- Rovine, calling the bluff, declares them both at risk should her attention be redirection from Hieronymus.

- The two continue bickering over whose departure from the Temple is more urgent, until Rovine offered to discuss anything Flick wanted to on the Temple ground.

- Flick: Well, in the meantime, Isabella sends her regards, and my name is Flick. Does that name sound familiar to you?

- Rovine: Yes, it does. Isabelle has talked about you I believe. I don’t know if she’s gone into that much detail. From what i remember, your name wasn’t to be brought up. I think she was deep in her cups and that’s how mention of you came about. You were supposed to be something of a secret. I would gladly speak with you afterwards and you are welcome for the display of sophisticated strategery which I am about to display.

- Slugg exhorts her vanguard to attack the enthroned Queen.

- Flick [INSIGHT ] realizes that Rovine was covering for his cowardice with the strategy bit.

- The kobolds, led by Slugg, stab into the Queen as a group.

- Flick and Jean-luc, exchanging aporiac looks, tacitly decide that the Queen’s attacks on Hieronymus don’t decide the ally-enemy issue sufficiently for either to cast their weight on either side.

- The attack on Hieronymus coincided with a loud scream by Roxffallana at the other temple. At the same time, Hiero screamed to fellows: We cannot let this slight against me go unavenged. To arms!

- The first celestial to appear, the Green Spring, now in full command of her weapon, swungs out with her longsword, releasing a coruscating arc of radiant fireworks which passes through the kobold mob, leaving each one burnt and lifeless.

- Flick [HIST 15] recalls that the Queen of the Sun has a coterie of bodyguards that protect her temples, and are related to either agricultural or natural cycles.

- Kobold blood begins to drench the nearby column, and another celestial form appears; the two guardians move to protect the Queen and release the other guards.

- Drav casts her eye to the entrance of the other temple, where Roxffalanah and Fez, now two small figures in the distance, appear unmolested.

- JOHN CULT-TRAIN

- they have salafist tendencies?

- Drav [HIST 16]: xanthuc temple was center of galactic polity - DM: the center got so nasty that everyone moved as far away as they could

    - Drav: I don’t feel too bad throwing a pot-shot at them then
    - Drav: is there anything elemental that they are resistant to ?
    - [Drav: nat 1 on INSIGHT: they are vulnerable to necrotic damage?]

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Angel takes a hit from melf’s acid arrow, and will take more damage next turn

- Rovine chicken-flies over the kobolds between him and the window, and tumbles through the window.

- Rovine: athletic prowess and something … allows you to do … on the battlefield

- H: I love you so much!

- Drav saw Rovine go directly over her: maybe a beard chap is what i need

- Carlos casts healing word on Hieronymus (“do i need a word for this?”) - H feels like most of the “word” went to the bagpipe somehow. H pumps fist and freeze-frames in the middle of the air, and tosses a party-favor bag of poison to Carlos: “Thank you!”

    <!-- -->

- H tries to his Queen , but misses, and can still spend a ki point to flurry of blows - hits once; slid so close to the throne that gives a one-inch punch

    <!-- -->

- H: i think she’s almost dead!

- Kobold?: the intruder fights back!

- wut ………….

- the Queen misses hieronymus because he’s so close

- H: you really beefed that one! and throws the meat into her face. the Queen knocks the meat into the nearest column.

- Orange Mist arises at the queen’s beckoning. - Sailor Moon, arise (no response from the other column)

    <!-- -->

- Queen: we’re more of an agricultural society; we stay away from the mountains. we’ve brought the mountains to us with the earthen mounds !

- DK readies an action

- Flick: Great queen, and creature of divinity: may we appeal to the great generosity you show as the giver of all bounty. \

- Queen: and what tokens do you bring to trumpet? signal? your goodwill

- Flick : we awoke you

- Queen: do you think i like being awoken to deal with the transgressions of mortals

- Flick: our transgressiosn were unwilling and i beseech you if i may withdraw this wellmeaning fool from your circle; we would depart your domain forever

- Q: this idiot has been marked by my scepter. and he shall not escape, except, if he gets out of here. he will serve as an example for all your kind. without having the proper tokens or lineage.

- Flick BA — 18 force damage; then sharpshoots — misses after a reaction protection cast on queen.

- Queen of the Sun: we’re protecting you from an even more dangerous force. - it’s Xanthu! who else would you think? Xanthu lends her name to these temples. Xanthuc is the locative ending.

    <!-- -->

- Flick: what a rich tongue.

- Queen: just like our kingdom used to be.

- Flick: if we can get H out of here, we’ll be on our way. Or I can … force … the issue.

- Queen: diplomatically ? sadly my ire has been raised and he must go!

- Suffers kobold attack.

- DK attacks first kobold to make a move as a sign of good faith to the queen.

- H shouts out “noooooo they are our friends!!”

- DK hits slug right in the chest: “Ughhhhhh” with a sneak attack damage arrow

- “miscellany of rusty daggers try to cut into the queen, like someone getting shivved in prison”

- Slugg: On, Bulgarius! bulgarius bites the queen with black liquid dripping from its mouth; the Queen screams, and Slugg slices her head right off; she disappears and the scepter clatters to the floor.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Angels: Queen! we will avenge your death, temporary as it may be! Until the next rulers can step up and revitalize you.

- FLick: da fuq?

- Angels: this was once the center of a great kingdom!

- Flick: A real Cressidan standoff (when everyone is pointing hand crossbows at each other)

- The Silver Wheat will let none go! pulls out a longsword and

    - Uncanny dodge used to halve damage.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Orange Mist? casts light on the stone tile, and Bulgarius disappears

    - should have let anyone roll arcana ?
    - it’s been banished to another plane.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Silver ?? comes down on Slugg and her longsword plunges through her body. maybe the armor … cushioned it ? “i’m in a bad way. get this flying duck off me” (redundant).

- Samuel … who the fuck … ?

- H, the original angel perks up and supermans over to you; she’s flying with her longsword straight out (

    - H is flatfooted ? does 23 points of damage.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav:

- Rovine: “do you need help getting your little dwarf feet up into the window. let me help you, teddy bear” — tell that elf this is part of my strategy to help the little ones get inside.

- Drav: 8d6 lightning damage, dex saving throw.

    - green spring, orange mist, silver wheat

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- ocean spray; sierra mist


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

same logical status d20 roll (etc) equals or exceeds number , then success; attack : equals or exceeds armor class saving throw: equals or exceeds DC

orange mists’s natural 1 — fried her wings; and she can’t fly anymore

- drav moves rest of movement over

- Rovine: these damn angels. what’s slug going to do without his beast? - dark cloud emerges from hands and settles onto the ground

    - Rovine: i can’t let a single kobold die. a single one would be unforgivable.
    - those guys have just hidden! or … fallen asleep ?
    - they tend to bleed easily. with the dry air — they’re used to a more aquatic environment. also i think bulgarius is back.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Carlos requests a boost from Rovine: “i need to go after my squishy friend”

- Rovine: please don’t attempt to remove my battle chaps. do you need a boost? i can see i’m an essential contributor to this battle.
- the kobolds aren’t interested in attacking Carlos — covered in hair. they are trying to protect themselves from the angels. (should i have required an insight check?)

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Jean-luc has “mad” hitpoints — using a qualitative HP system. Carlos moves himself in front of drav Drav hugs carlos. Carlos heals Hiero. Can drav lend her power to Carlos — she’s just so touched. but is unable to. Carlos casts the protective version of “these rocks look great”

Heiro can see Rovine through the window. “we could really use your help about now!”

- R: i think they just want us outside? [persuasion 8] “yeah outside seems pretty safe to me”

- H: maybe i’ll join you out there! runs towards him.

- OA from the green spring. H goes to run and GS slashes his back wide open, and he goes splashing across the floor.

- Hiero has a dying vision of Roxfallanah jumping through the window, galloping over to hiero, throwing her hooves in the air, and screaming “no no why?!” and then H’s ghost rises up from his corpse and flies into the mouth of the mule, and the mule bucks around a bit like a possessed/and/or/castrated pig. H speaks from the mule: “it’s ok everyone, don’t worry” —

- the rest of you see the kobolds and rovine stars smelling the air: kobols shout : not haired?? and start snuffling around the open body

- jean-luc tells angel that he is not its enemy.

    - angel: of course you are, you’re in our temple!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick: run towards me!

    - silver wheat slashes at JL ineffectually as he disengages and runs towards flick
    - JL: i’m going to respectfully decline
    - Angel: impossible! a declination is inherently disrespectful.
    - then JL turns back and fires. — critically fails.
    - SW deflects arrow back into stairs; the entrance to stairs crumbles and is blocked.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick: bonus action Zephyr’s strike. — looks over to chaos on right, and JL “who’s a pretty cool guy” and i dash to go to his aid. i think my buddies have throne chaos pretty well in hand.

- Flick gives one last chance to … surrender

    - 21 piercing.
    - Angel: can your arrows bring down a magnificent bird such as myself?!
    - 22 piercing. I say ……… xhhhhhah. she disappears in a flash of radiant light.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- F checks in with JL. didn’t i tell you about that time i was in a horse-house in whatever city that was

- F takes cover behind column. JL feels cool wind rush up and carry her off.

- Slugg calls out into the darkness for Balgarius and goes to attack Green Spring.

    - force of Slugg’s loyalty to steed gives her power to cut through this Angel; she disappears in a blast of energy.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

title: ? - “the object of their swordly attentions”

- orange mist: my green sister, do not leave me here landbound!”

- “out of the darkness and into the fray!” — balgarius lunges out and latches onto Orange Mist’s leg.

    - get your ugly beast off me! I’m an angel … of the mist !!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- all the other kobolds start sniffing and moving closer to hieronymus, and pawing at his open wounds.

    - H takes 5 points of eating damage and fails a death saving throw.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Orange Mist tells kobolds to go back where they came from. she is hurt too much; can’t get longsword into play; she can’t fly away either; she’s unavle to do anything except the dodge action.

- give angels self-healing from now on.

- drav casts fire bolt.

- hears in the wall “help me first. my situation is dire here”

    - can see the vague three-dimensional outline of a face pushing its way through the wall. “just another moment and i’ll be dead” [drav 8 insight] — you are not unconvinced by its plea.
    - carlos [25 insight] — it’s definitely lying. it’s not in a dire situation. — Carlos: ignore the wall, drav!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- (wall): ignore me at your peril. this involves all of us.

- Carlos taps on its face. these rock-like claws come and swipe at you; it looks like they are trying to pull you in with it. Skip nimbly out of the way.

- Drav shouts: “get away from our friend!” \*\*should have allowed strength (intimidation)

    - the kobolds are too busy engaged in eating.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav tries to “killing dissuade them”

- shatter with sculpt spell.

    - under the floor of temple; circle opens up in the floor; crushes all the kobolds. hiero’s body left on a perfect pillar holding him up. underneath, you’ve exposed some sort of hidden chamber.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- ROvine: looks like you all have this handled (backs up slowly)

- Carlos casts healing word at 1st level again on .. .H?

- He’s alive!!!

- Hiero — multitude of kobold body parts strewn across rugged collapsed sunken chamber. hole.

    - H bows to those around him; thank you! i was rather enjoying being torn apart but i understand that ultimately it wouldn’t have been great for me. you each get a poison (oprah style)

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Carlos pats XANTHU on the head some more

    - “this is a matter of some urgency! i will bring you in here with he, and then you’ll be forced to help solve it”

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- SIerra Chunks is my other sister.

- Heiro casts Faerie Fire. affects Slug and Bulgarius.

- even with dog attached to her leg, and slugg pressed in close, she manages to dodge out of the way. — they both start shedding light in a 10-foot radius. (almost like she can turn light on and off)

- JL moves to get better angle on Orange Mist to fire an arrow.

    - DK [9] to attack.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick : amazing how much aplobm she has

    - a new family will emerge and we will again defend the temple for ritual purposes.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick moves 35 feet — addresses orange mist in elvish: “creature of light and air, answer me true as your nature demands: if we slay you , will that release the creature that your queen mentioned?”

    - OM: it will not, but it will mean we’ve failed in ejecting you from the temple.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- flick’s in love. and then fires at her. after she commits to getting them out. flick misses.

- OM: the power of xanthu still allows me to reject your claim to this place.

    - she now demonstrates a renewed vitality; as slugg slashes at OM, she dodges both of them with alacrity. — I will be able to hold you off in the end!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- OM brings sword down on Slugg , and up to the hilt, but Slugg is standing there, one hand on bulgarius, looking menacingly. — this is our space now! whatever you do, we’re going to claim it, and your stupid old family will never get it back!

- Slugg: i would give my life first before i let balgarius die (not BULGarious) ; it’s more like a schaw.

- Drav magic missle: 12 force damage. to kill the orange mist. 3 glowing darts appear, and strike her in the heart.

    - OM: you should know that you will not be served well in this place. there are other forces that will seek to expell you!! and exterminate you !!! the stone man is xanthuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu—

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Slugg: nice work. nice missile trick. it reminds me: i knew a kobold named Myssultriq. a real upstanding citizen. i think he was mayor of kobold town for a while. i never visited.

- Flick: i want to head down into the chamber.

    - casts goodberry and gives 6 to jeal-luc.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

    - JL eats one of them now.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- stone man not emerging further from the wall.

- drav: we’re standing just out of range taunting him.

- Flick: goodberries falling about 6 feet above. then a tail is hanging out. part of balgarius’s tale is cut off in mid air.

    - sheared clean from where it’s hanging. flick pulls tail towards herself. picks up slack in tail; looks like Flick is pulling B’s tail.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Flick feeds tail back in through hole. palpable hole / rim to portal. as last of tail goes in, flick pinches the boundary closed (or is that what did it?) — but slowly.


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

XANTHU: help me get out of here. now that the angels are gone, it’s even more urgent.

- Drav [arcana nat 1]:

- carlos [13] — not quite sure what this is. it feels vaguely evil.

- hasn’t been 10 minutes since cast THese rocks look great.

    - Carlos wants to see what happens when spell wears out

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- Drav peaks over edge of hole

    - see the rubble and kobold bodies. faint sound of blood dripping out of them. hiero is still stuck on the pillar.
    - room extends in either direction, at least to each side fo the temple. trouble seeing to the right, but can see to the left, and looks like there might be holes in the ground but too dark to tell.
    - drav looks around first floor for hidden staircase.

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->

- FLick; you don’t see Rovine anymore. you do see a 15 foot tall purple gnomelike creature. dressed like a bespoke vampire. white ascot, and form-fitting tailored 3-piece suit. shiny winklepickers.

    - flick: greetings, dapper fellow. did you happen to see a large, strategically gifted ogre mage around here.
    - rovine: it’s me, you idiot. i can’t believe i just had to confirm that for you.
    - flick: we dealt with the angels
    - rovine/raxivort: all part of the plan!

    <!-- -->

    <!-- -->


<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Drav discovers another secret stairway in the other corner (lower right?)

ROvine walks further into the room, : my unamed minion, look at you! you’ve proven yourself as Slugg, the chieftain, i bestow upon you my boon! (improvised little ceremony; licks his hand and brushes down balgarius’s fur) — Keep up the good work!! then Rovine takes a practical magic smoke bomb and back out the room. — Slugg: ahhhhh my lord raxivort!!

- Rovine winks at Drav on the way out.
