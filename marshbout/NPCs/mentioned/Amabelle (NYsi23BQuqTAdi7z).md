- The dwarven sorceress who transformed Roxfallanah into Mule. 
- Vengeance remembers her as being very stylish, wearing a top hat and statement glasses, a lot of tattoos and a cool braided beard. 
- \- Star: did you say amabelle? well she used to run with the fiend; she was a tatoo artist and she did his first tats, and they started running together. she’s a real legend in the biz; her tattoos could do pretty much anything. stuff as far as healing people, or giving them really big appetites, just a huge puff of some sweeet grass; she could eliminate a hangover if she wanted.
