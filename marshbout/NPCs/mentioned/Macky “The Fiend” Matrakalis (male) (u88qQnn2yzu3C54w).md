## his demise

- Vengeance (if i could find the Fiend I could get to her. but it’s a shame that he’s dead.)

- <div>- Star; it is too bad. it’s too bad he couldn’t live up to his namesake and live forever in the underworld, but we all have to embrace the cycle of life.</div>

    <div>- Vengeance: he really went out with a bang, being thrown into that volcano.&nbsp;</div>

- \- Star: yeah some people say that everytime you breathe in a little bit of ash, from your stogie, that you’re breathing in the Fiend. and i love that view, that he’s impeding my breathing a little bit and could one day cause my death through the growth of cancerous flesh. it’s a really great thing to look at things. and what you say about the world being small, this planet for sure is really small.
