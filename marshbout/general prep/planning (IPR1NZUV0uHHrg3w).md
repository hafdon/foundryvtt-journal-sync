- somehow flick ports them somewhere?

- FACTION: Fang of the Besh'ti (the ancient Girallon guardians) - Graal's arm eaten by Oklmuk didn't heal correctly, and she came to this necromancer on her way back to the homeland.

    <!-- -->

- FENIENDUM: what is her deal? oh yeah, part of the fang of the besh'ti. collecting these zombies to use them (fang is just a metonym : they want the whole body) - background: her sister Gaduul married her ex-lover Hautesse, and now their mother, (Leathan "Knottybones"), dotes on Gauduul and her new psychic twins (Mamonas and Nychtbouris)

<div>ok what's going to happen in this session.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Drav: spell ink from Rotrude or Hiero's blue boils</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Fez: [INT] shipwreck happened at night, so how does he remember seeing Abzû</div>

<div>- Fez: [INT] can remember something about the Teallacht mentioned by Abzû</div>

<div> - learns the Deep Undersea language from Abzû, not Ulimara</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick: foil ranger (super laid back; never strings bow; always wants to slow things down and look around)</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Hiero: spells like Befuddlement</div>

<div> - unerring strike</div>

<div> - confounding strike</div>

<div> - more people that want to torture with him but present an obstacle in some way.&nbsp;</div>

<div> - continuing nightmares from the boil disease ('Bluerot', <a class="inline-roll roll" title="1d4" data-mode="roll" data-flavor="" data-formula="1d4">1d4</a>&nbsp;hours) even tho it's 'cured'</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Jean-luc: spell Blacksteel</div>

<div>- Jean-luc: if he actually becomes an alcoholic, give him some Way of the Drunken Monk stuff</div>

<div> - Rogue: Perished features since interaction with Marjorie</div>

<div></div>

## future ideas

<div>- they actually go to an "Undead Horror Show" (how Fez described Undead Rotrude)</div>

<div>- in-universe rapper "tood arts" (from 2Dartz)</div>

<div>- Carlos: genie warlock -- tobolux / or great old one warlock</div>

<div> - Unseen Servant</div>
