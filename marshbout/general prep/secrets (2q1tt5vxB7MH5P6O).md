## hieronymus

<div>- apprehensive about the eventual freestyle battle between himself and rotrude</div>

<div>- thinks he's the most powerful being in the universe now</div>

<div>- thinks the adventuring companions want to learn from him and look up to him</div>

<div>- becoming a mighty oak ("the mighty elk" of Fez!)</div>

<div>- wanted to drown his parents as a boy</div>

<div>- NPCs: more people that want to experience mortification with him but present an obstacle in some way</div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>**, as Hieronymus, though for the latter the metamorphosis is a state of being from which he derives no small measure of pleasure. **</div>

<div>mick always plays fez so … kind of nasty, i’m never sure what to do. i definitely can’t take the head-on villain tact with him. probably someone who makes him feel superior. send him a squire, basically.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- so with this girl, have her appear and be like "ohhhhh, i was being kept back by some interference with another creature " (assumption is kraken) and also she's the one who's actually repressing fez's ulimara abilities, and was sent by kraken to make it seem like his abilities were from kraken? altho if it _can_ do all that.. ?</div>

<div></div>

<div>mortification, flagellation, penance, piety,&nbsp;</div>

<div>— why IS hiero into self torture</div>

<div></div>

<div>Mortification of the flesh is an act by which an individual or group seeks to mortify, or put to death, their sinful nature, as a part of the process of sanctification.</div>

<div></div>

<div>sackcloth or hairshirts, self-denial</div>

<div>subduing, suppression, subjugation, control, controlling, restraint; disciplining, chastening, punishment, denying.</div>

<div></div>

<div>harrow, torment, afflict, plague, distress, agonize, rack,&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>- ROtrude: Have you been off on one of your meditative journeys again? And what is this fascinating energy coming from the room you're in.</div>

<div>- Heiro: THat is the dirt spirit.</div>

<div>[[should have moved the action forward here]] -- this is gossipping</div>

<div></div>

<div>Fez has a Vek root in his bag.</div>

<div>- give Fez like ... the ability to have different abilities like he has a flail.&nbsp;</div>

<div>- also Bypass. Flexible weapons with the Bypass property are unaffected by directly blocking the blow. These weapons ignore the AC bonus from shields and Defensive weapons. The target can still use the Raise Shield combat action (pg. 18) to make your attack miss.&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>Drav: if she uses the ink from the boils to write down spells. ...&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>"the hounds of love" exist in this world - trudy</div>

<div></div>

<div>DK -- something that gives him +proficiency bonus to initiative</div>

<div></div>

<div>spell attack critical hit would be interesting for Drav --&nbsp;</div>

<div></div>

<div>CRABS</div>

<div></div>

<div>flick: is shoemaker a druid-litch. is that his phylactery?</div>

<div>fez: should have had ulimara / nevlim intervene to stop being frightened of Vek</div>

<div></div>

<div>lol, a David-litch</div>

<div>galen: glove / gauntlet; hair shirt</div>

<div>angela: armor</div>

<div>mick/fez: warlock with hidden patron (kraken)</div>

<div></div>

<div>what does shoemaker’s helmet do? the fire thing?</div>

<div></div>

<div>not fear against Fez (Charisma +9)</div>

<div>not charmed against Flick</div>

<div>against flick: damage resistance to piercing from nonmagical</div>

<div></div>

<div>some creatures live in the mountains</div>

<div>a river in the mountains</div>

<div>a marsh</div>

<div>maybe a mountain lake</div>

<div>creatures born on treestumps</div>

<div></div>

<div>so i just need past and items for:</div>

<div>hieronymus — give him paros’s telepathic bracers.&nbsp;</div>

<div>flick</div>

<div>fez: setarra-blood sorcerer / or a kraken warlock</div>

<div>Pact of the Talisman (better than he thinks he is)</div>

<div> - altho more like a sorcerer since he (fez) doesn’t really know about it</div>

<div> - OOH UNLESS he made the pact to survive when he was out cold, and now doesn’t remember it.</div>

<div>UACFV p11</div>

<div>Your patron gives you a special amulet, a talisman that can aid you, or anyone else who wears it, when the need is great. When the wearer makes an ability check with a skill in which they lack proficiency, they can add a d4 to the roll.</div>

<div></div>

<div>If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The talisman turns to ash when you die.</div>

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>jean-luc</div>

<div>- cheap-shot (traits)</div>

<div></div>

<div>- Flick believes Snav to be a functionary that has unsavory ties, like Molotov</div>

<div>(Snav Snifter)</div>

<div>- I have to remember that i have to talk to everyone _except_ ian because he will do all the talking on his own.&nbsp;</div>
