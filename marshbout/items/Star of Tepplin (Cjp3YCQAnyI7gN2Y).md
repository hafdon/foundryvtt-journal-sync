<div>Eight-pointed silver star</div>

<div></div>

<div>One of the symbols of Tepplin Baronian; in particular, that of his distilleries in Albland. When he fortified the compound after raids who were after a secret ingredient, it was suggested that he use the eight-point shape. It's suspected that the color of the star has something to do with the secret ingredient they were after, as a kind of "fuck you."</div>

<div></div>

<div>Entirely by accident, Jean-luc claimed to the Seomra "Elphs" that he was a constable or retriever for Baronian's estate and that Flick and Aphelia had stolen a secret recipe used to make one of the draughts.&nbsp;</div>
