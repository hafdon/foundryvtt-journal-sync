PUTTY voice<br>

get an Aule voice<br>

write up carlos's switch initiative positions<br>

ian: aggressively secular; im a roman stoic<br>

real anti-science strain<br>

ian: doesn't get off the ground until 1920s until america<br>

shitauqua revivalism; science education in schools

starting: just took a long rest soul rock was taking a bath the last they saw of him

flick: they never revealed themselves to me; my foster parents never revealed themselves to me; they let me keep the wolf; snav did not mention isabelle; and maybe he thought that isabelle was lupenna who was locked away in the bear vase (snav sent us to castle karn in the first place)

Remy Flitch

Isabella as an Oni can change her size and form and appearance; acting as Lupenna while lupenna was out hunting down tantegorisch. Isabella knew what happened to Lupenna. isabella was surprised that something she was working for fell into her lap lupenna was plane-hopping. caught in a bear-plane. almost an accident that it manifested as a bear. the place itself is just like the material plane. ian: we didn't destroy the plane itself. no, you popped a whitehead on the plane's skin. figurine acted as a homing beacon. when VV tried to take over your mind and have you see lupenna, that did bring an authentic vision of her to you, and she was trying to communicate with isabella. flick: was it just a lucky coincidence? was the portal opened from the inside, by lupenna, or did isabella's touching it open it lupenna opened it, and the figuring allowed her to find an exit; she wasn't familiar with the plane, and it was directing hostility towards being breached.

flick: why were you posing as lupenna? i don't mean to be self-centered, but what gives. people back in marshbout knew where to find someone that they thought was lupenna. were you laying breadcrumbs.

change of administration? / continuity of administration

oni: if i pretended to be Lupenna, there would be a continuity of administration; they expected her to be here as Raul's daughter. a boogieman monster living in the castle would have caused a stir

- flick: domonkos thinks this is his castle. i haven't seen a deed but that seems accurate.

- isabella: my brother is a full oni, he's … related to the reappearance of buggshosh, - he's having some difficulty in resisting returning to his cannibalistic ways.

    - Uncle Rovine [I'm not sure why I have "uncle" here?]. BS is one of the elder gods. Carlos had a vision of. Rovi is my half-brother. he's full oni. do i have a child? i don't know. rovi's innate urge is to eat children. carlos: … lupenna a long time ago, lupenna removed the urges, and certain things changed recently, and he doesn't have the same protections up.

- carlos: the kids deserve it - isabella: are very tasty. oh, yes, hahaha.

lupenna is flick's godmother.

flick: the gnoll hunters took us in, and they needed help with something. carlos: we saved the princess flick: well they were also being bothered by the bog witch, --- or the gnolls could probably help us. flick: the grenlich is no doubt a lot stronger than the gnolls, but the gnolls are more well-meaning. but they still need our help

kolmy is trying to change the entire moral system of gnolls brak shortpaw flick: mostly i want to see thaz again, because i have a thing for her.

some gnolls were saved in the oven lum and cora were in the refrigerator.

flick: tantegorisch is going to come for me, eventually. this is what i was given to understand by lupenna. the wolf figurine was some kind of radar blocker that rendered me invisible. when T starts looking, he'll be able to find us but flick goes to get some sleep

was lupenna a werejackal all along? how did she fall in with all these spirit ogres? is it through VV connection? did they all use to work at Castle Karn Lupenna is like a hell-hound like her father (and part elf) --

\*\* jake: it's interesting he wants to resorb you, given that he doesn't know where you've been 'resorbing me is gonna be so good -- believe me, you want to resorb me'

isabella comes up with pancakes to drav and carlos look like you have unfocused eyes paros: they are focused from 18-24 inches isabella: one at each? paros -- yes, reading 2 books isabella: ooh, you'll have to teach me that.

boggshush. such a bogg. BS, you know. 'sometimes it's easier to abbreviate'

riult's spellbook can't be damaged by fire or water, and won't deteriorate with age. flick: you can cast in the shower but it has a curse on it now.

'Aquamuck'

carlos (jake): maybe they can take me to whatever dimension they hang out in (naphula? and gluder?)

Drav: transcription of the Xanthu tablets. covered in black leather; printed on a printing press. at least 200 years ago. describing the ways in which the followers of BS would prostrate themselves, the language the cultists would use, how they would worship, some of the rituals they would use to invoke BS. also: historical text: the present state of the islands in Snaff Bay. touches on how the myths regarding islands greated when top of grey tongue severed; but how before that, the depression made by one of the forms of boggshush and how it was kicked out by the gods working together. but it's always retained that imprint.

i have paros roll for his new sanity stat [10] . attribute. jake: it's like the carebears movie flick: i'm still tripping balls on all those goodberries i ate Revelations of Nundocamar. (almost sounds like a jedi but not quite) jedi terrorist. terrorist group ? three folios that have been bound into one volume.

paros retreats into own mind while reading the text; suddenly it feels [19] roll for feel. felt this before. because he's done training to read people's minds and telepathize with people. usually it's a johnny mnemonic space; but this time he feels paralyzed; drav notices. johnnny NO-monic. drav: 15 … perception. paros's breathing becomes very shallow and his eyes close. he has a heartbeat. drav has seen this before as a wizard; if you'd casts a paralyze spell.

carlos: is that a problem? did the book cast its own spell on paros?

paros hears veenock. 'wonderful to be reacquainted with you.' paros derived his power from a demon that he made a magical pact with. ? (sorcerers - special lineage, or sell souls -- that's actually warlock) convort paros from sorcerer to warlock veenock and nundocamar competed a long time ago to take over this high elven cleric Valeryl; like beryl, but val. carlos: why do these demons waste themselves on paros? paros: it's mutual veenock: i'm trapped in here paros: maybe my mind is some kind of candy they can't ignore.

drav wants to get him to wake up. you can see his hands starting to twitch writing 'valeryl' in clumsy elementary school letters. drav runs and gets carlos flick has cast 'PFGE' on paros before.

veenock: nundocamar got the elves body to apply some talisman to shield his body from me. the defeat bothered me and still does. veenock: 'i want you to get me that ring' 'one of my metaphysical ears is stuffed up'

drav comes across the loose manuscript flick: 'we got fucking props. this campaign fucking slaps'

the watermark from Eaton \*\* paper store: ahh, just a papyrus outlet! matt: either well to do, or lived in that area

carlos: has veenock's advice paid off? paros: veenock told me to grab the ashes from defeating naphula and gluder

flick: can joan and i spend the day to check out the north tower. she hasn't had as much time for me with her egg to take care of

\*\* remy flitch might come up to us and ask for back-pay; we fought a demon fish that let us breath underwater. you think you're shit, you low-level rogue.

drav look through Xanthu tablets to see if there's anything practical find the text of the rituals to invoke a henchman or apparition of boggshush, and by studying the ritual, you could figure out how to stop it; nat 1: so drav thinks she knows how to stop it.

north tower is tidy; quaint. smoke coming out of the chimney. flick: i knock an arrow and proceed through the portcullis. tools for landscaping and masonry; workman shed; hay

flick: 'doing joan: 'what is this, a tower for eggs?!' '

paros: what if someone's casting create smoke? people: looks like things have been recently moved around; pieces of fresh earth; not crusty earth flick searches shelves and tools thoroughly. (masterwork weapons and amulets) 17 investigation find a rope of climbing what attracts my attention? made of silk. fizzlecyst silk. not poisoned. coarse silk. hoist it. 3 pounds. tke it out into light; can i tell anything about its tensile strength. not made of twine. constructed very well, it doesn't fray. test its strength, it holds surprisingly strongly. it's not elastic. (fizzlecyst silk is elastic, tho, says flick) domonkos and S&M stuff. weird shit? Straight out the Butt. album title. part of textile process. stay wuv, everyone. 'i'll have snav take a look at it later'

joan: while he's burgling them. joan smashes bottom of the door up

shoplifting. simpsons. pick up stands to pick up sweet sweet olives.

'you can take whatever's not nailed down' 'you can talk to anyone with a name above their heads'

pair of gloves that aren't used for landscaping. made out of marine animal's skin. sealskin? patterns over them, where barnacles had attached, and been ripped off, makes white sigils.

joan then knocks on the door they open door, joan stays on feet and don't kick the person 'why are you trying to break my door down' flick: 'i suddenly realize we have no good reason to be here' jake: 'why are you casting create smoke?' somebody wearing a hair net, and clothes in fine and soft plaid pajamas making breakfast

flick: can i ask you questions hale: can you help me fix the door? has a huge goiter on the neck orbell head pokes way around her joan: 'will the bison hold my egg?' hale: 'you want to know if orbell will hold your egg' has heard of lupenna i'm just passing through hale: i'm an itinerant herder; not a tramp, a herder ian: [14] insight, yeah she's telling the truth joan fills hole with dirt; it's not fixed but i can see where you're going with this joan pets orbell

flick: we're trying to get a feel for the environs smells very earth; cooking up a breakfast; like a delicious savory breakfast, greens being tossed around too. 'the name's hale -- would you like breakfast? more like my mid-morning meal' 'i've been up for 6 hours' flick: see tracks?

jake: how come orbell gets preferential treatment? joan: is hale exaggerating her herder status orbell has a festering wound joan finds some pr'lll [20] investigation. in earthenware jars flick: i can communicate with it 'to an unschooled person would sound like friendly noises -- communicating that i'm a friend of the land' joan stripping the copper wiring

hale: things left over from previous resident. flick: anything strange or offputting. i can defend myself against wolves or coyotes attacking the herd flick describes mushroom dog fetuses and the leaf dog

fick: 'i don't want to alarm you, but i wouldn't go too much further west' hale: 'you're describing the deciduous forests. i try to stay out of the forest. ' a lot of spirits and evil creatures flick: i would have put that down to provincial nonsense flick offers goodberry to orbell gives hale 2 pounds of fizzlecyst meat. \*\* 'time doesn't pass in the bag of holding' -- definitely not true instructions on how to cook it so --- is fiszzlecyst meat bad?<br>

A spell called rope trick

joan found some reddish-gold metal ingots orbell tells them about two triangles, spiralling around it felt like it wanted my heart flew above you why are you limping: orbell: congenital defect amongst some of the rubbing, on the ankle typically they callous over and then it's not a problem

Baron Won Ween -- legally distinct 'orbell's a good egg' flick feeds Orbell 2 goodberries image of snav that pops into his head; seems like he's superimposed on the trees -- sideways trees that were around thuridan because of the way his bubble interacted with material plane. snav isn't alarmed or in danger. goodberries materialize as per usual. orbell: quite a lot of sugar flick: 'i think you're gonna like the stuff' paros: you know that grass turns into sugar… that's like the whole point

orbell deadenbacher joan officially has a tail

downstairs walls 12 feet thick; alcoves come to point for arrows upstairs walls thinner; central place, and doorso leading out into exterior central room is dining room; old table; chairs; flick is taken aback that the structure is so mundane. thrown off by snav vision. put off by how mundane structure is. so she detects portal to make something interesting happen

\*\* in-world seltzer kegs flick: is it really just a shepherd waystation

\*\* maybe restrict ian's detect portal to ¼ mile, because i just can't joan is drawing on the egg with hale and …

the note was tucked between two other volumes; someone probably took the rest of it and left that page there describing where nicklefurrow is paros: Commentary on the diaskisdein i have to get some of zorbwood. fascinating stuff.

hale has drawn a picture of dravita. that leaked horribly. you burned it. joan hears faintly the sound of grass burning, or an animal screaming. and flick detects a very tiny portal below you, right on this egg. flick: i rush downstairs and take a close look. egg starting to ooze a fowl greyish liquid. starting to ooze feather liquid. it's starting to hatch. flick tells joan to put the egg down for a second. but joan did want to have experienced people flick backs up as far as she can get joan just sees the drawing what happens to the feathers? they're being sucked into joan's bag, into a heavy part of the bag flick: i ask if i can see, and approach cautiously feathers are passing through the bagg, and passing into the ingots, and then coating them, like they are wrapping the ingots. flick goes to pick up ingot. Wisdom check 13. everything in front of her appear back, then pointilistic spots of light appear; no proprioception. going to focus on points of light and see if they cohere into anything mimetic. flick in real life hunches over the egg protecting it flick in vision sees juniper in negative 'it is not time for me to to be born yet. why are you trying to open this egg with your portals' juniper three school was the original sausage person in the candy lab with the spirited away mask. three school an ancient constellation of creatures. and there are other three schools with their own curriculum. and juniper studies life and death. flick: 'i wasn't aware i could open anything. has it had the effect every time?' juniper: i think there's something in the vicinity. jake: it was causing problems for solrak too, wasn't it? flick: you need to let me go. juniper: i'm not the one that's holding you here. angela: hale was drawing on the egg? juniper: you were the one that made contact with me.

joan grabs the ingot out of flick's hand. wrapped around egg, drooling on it. feels a residual need to stay hunched around it. joan: 'hale thinks we're crazy now, thanks to you' hale: i just sort of zoned out and started drawing these on the egg; hobo signs oh, the people here will attack you, or they are very nice jake: what did she draw? dravita. having never met it before? flick: she claimed not to have seen any of the mushroom dogs flick turns to orbell; try to convey to him 'who is hale --- have you seen her take off her mask' 'who is she right before she goes to sleep' i can talk with it because i'm a ranger, not because it's a magical beast joan: what does this symbol mean to the tramps? this means that, uh, you can usually find some pretty cool tools and stuff in the shed outside the tower i'm doing it on an egg, it's not on the wall jake: have you drawn that one before? it's one of the lesser used ones, but sure flick does a somersault out the door back to the library -- midday joan: it smells like asparagus popcurn in here? drav tries to figure out … the text jokes on text of jabberwocky 'ya best start believing in grey tongues, lassy' \_ simpsons reference by ian? leuqline is like a ley line 'where a bunch of people each give you a flower wreath, one after the other' jukas: like a star wars swear carlos in particular would know what it is: when you dispel undead, you can see the signs of their passage. jukas is the name for that image; like undead … spoor. the signs that ghosts leave. aule is interested in extirpating them. and sirmgalv? - drav: you may not have known this before; almost like a world tree, but also known as the EarthRoot. a very powerful grounding force for the planet in the plane. things that have been splintered off of it have powerful magic baked into it. like the fountain of youth in that people look for it. carlos: maybe we will find magical weapons and undead stuff in nicklefurrow

- tobolux bottle exploding

- cork pops out and stream of flower petals pushes itself out of bottle.

    - voluminous clouds of petals fill the air to the point that you are choking.
    - it's fragrant but it smells like burnt vegetation.
    - tobolux doesn't come out.
    - carlos: is this what happens to ifrits when they die?
    - carlos: maybe she cried to death? but we didn't think we killed her. (yes, aule said she was healed)
    - form this cloud that settles on the ground, that starts disintegrating; a mist that remains inside the bottle that isn't coming out.
    - doesn't seem like it would be in aule's domain.

flick is worried about the gnolls, hearing about the things from orbell carlos: maybe the weird dogs are coming through portals? carlos: and then we'll go to the slubber to help the geniis in need.

domonkos and lupenna will work it out between them. we're both essentially immortal, so perhaps a time share. joint custody of the castle. drav: draw a line down the center lupenna empties out a bag of rice: domonko counts
