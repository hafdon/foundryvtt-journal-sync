- quick check: you don't take disadvantage on saving throws for 1 level of exhaustion. 

Call of Cthulhu promotes interesting roleplaying, because play frequently hinges on difficult choices: were you right, for instance, in burning down a farmhouse full of cultists, when in the eyes of the law your actions were murderous? 

Linguistics (Decipher csript; speak language)

- More opportunity attacks (pg. 60 in _Fifth Edition Options_ (TPK) allows melee characters to be better (make sure they don't overlap with feats like Mage Slayer though)

Drav: magical foci

I don't think there are actual things like "rogues" -- should ahve them say "do i spot a fellow such-and-such a clan, or thief , or something

Motivation should be insight. Also, if the player asks for a type of check, let them make it (especially if it's just to know something). 

Emily's NPCs are just there to deliver information and get out of the way.

Parts of a temple or tower or city or something
This portion is called the "girdle," and if we take this as a defining line, that portion which appears above the setting of this girdle, is called the "crown"; the portion below the girdle is called the "culasse," or less commonly the "pavilion." The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones
The word 'culasse' comes from a French word meaning 'back'.

## industry

### tanning
- Once the hair was removed, the tanners would "bate" (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, __or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains__.
- The steps in the production of leather between curing and tanning are collectively referred to as beamhouse operations. They include, in order, soaking, liming, removal of extraneous tissues (unhairing, scudding and fleshing), deliming, bating or puering, drenching, and pickling.

### items
- phase box
- drop-spine box
	- drop-spine box with interior cradle
- cloth-covered clamshell box
- Anthropodermic bibliopegy (the practice of binding books in human skin.)
- "souvenirs" Are defined (by the FBI) as items that are used to fuel the fantasies of a serial killer, whereas "trophies" are objects that are saved as proof of his skill.
- "a nipple belt"
- Tibetan Buddhists employe the kangling, a trumpet made from a human thighbone [which imho looks like a giant dick and balls]
- _taw_: make (hide) into leather without the use of tannin, especially by soaking it in a solution of alum and salt. (as compared to tanning)
- _alum_: typically refers to _potassium alum_ or _aluminum sulfate_ (papermaker's alum)
	- in the middle ages, misy, sory, and chalcanthum could mean alum or green vitriol (iron sulfate)
	- many uses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alum#Uses)
		- In the Philippines, alum crystals were also burned and allowed to drip into a basin of water by babaylan (shamans) for divination. 
- _gum arabic_ (should be _acacia gum_ in a fantasy world)
- a (leather) scudding scraper (as a weapon?)

- The Caballine Spring
> Caballine or caballine
PRONUNCIATION:
(KAB-uh-lyn/leen) 

MEANING:
adjective:
1. Giving inspiration.
2. Relating to horses.

ETYMOLOGY:
From Latin caballus (horse). Earliest documented use: 1430.

NOTES:
In Greek mythology, Hippocrene was a spring on Mt. Helicon that was created by a stroke of Pegasus’s hoof. If we can have a word coined after Greek hippos (horse), why not coin one after Latin caballus (horse), as well.

USAGE:
“In memory of which nobody is now matriculated in the said University of Poitiers unless he has drunk from the Caballine fountain of Croustelles.”
François Rabelais (Translation: M.A. Screech); Gargantua and Pantagruel; 1938.

## Fez
- Fez: Figure out if he will lie in order to prove a point, or if the lies he makes are just about him, or if "being right" _is_ about him. for instance, is this:
- Fez rather pedantically and tiresomely inquires as to the ethical system which would allow one to attack those thought weaker than oneself, but the moment they are proven stronger, that person then desires peace. [zw - which means that Fez might think a few things: 1. you can attack someone you think is weaker as long as, if it turns out they are stronger, you keep attacking; 2. you should not 'sue for peace' if things don't turn out the way you want them to: you should always fight to the end
- Believes the ratfolk religion is primitive (and that there are "primitive religions") -- or just that it's a matriarchy. Ok, so Mick wants it to be a surprise to Fez that Ulimara is female and that's who gives him his power.

## Flick
Flick: How does Ian explain Flick's natural explorer ability that gives her advantage on attack rolls against creatures that haven't gone yet in combat?
- "talk shit get hit": if flick has a religion, that's one of its commandments. 

> Fez: No, most civilized areas _do_ mark their sacred sites. Cities, Hobbittons, pretty much the whole thing is covered in signage.

- Emily: metaphorically connect two things (almost like bad segue humor) (Caldwell's Gremlin voice, and the mixed bag about DM questions = DM questions can be gremlins in the mind)
- Emily's
	- structure for encounters
	- method of describing things

- so far a lot of my encounters seem to be: you meet this group. they tell you to get lost. what, you can't help getting involved? ok they try to murder you, and/or defend themselves.
