- keep in mind there's a difference between plot/suspense bullshit that makes me angry, and ways people treat each other that makes me angry

## supergirl

1. when Hank is like "might learn a thing or two about what it's like for the rest of us" when kara isn't regaining her pwoers (which is basically what her sister just said, but so fucking pedantic and supercilious)
2. whyyyyyyy would _hank_ think they have a problem, just because sister SECRETLY suspects him of killing her father? 
3. why's this other dumb agent yelling at sister for "where's director henshaw"? how the fuck is she supposed to know?
4. "i'm never disappointed in supergirl. i was disappointed in you." wow you stupid incel dick she gets you have emotions and not want to date you you entitled whiny prick.
5. hey callista flockheart stop yelling at supergirl you dumb bitch (blah blah people rely on you now). supergirl is too good for that tho, "that's why i'm glad they had you. i know that you inspired them because ... you inspired me."
6. was it your strength or her weakness
7. why did you hesitate ? -- because your my sister -- what if i wasn't (UHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
8. FAITH ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!
9. we're the same, you and i (i being a crazy murderer). that same crazy murdering madness that's in me, it's in you, too.
10. to think, i was once linked to the great kaluan cyber construct ... 
11. you have only revealed yourself because so-and-so is dead. why?
12. you would still be sleeping in that timeless void if it wasn't for me, activating your pod so i could hitchhike the jail onto it and escape the phantom zone?
13. "synthetic K"
14. the truth hurts. in more ways than one.
15. state of the art. in more ways than one.
16. luck of the irish. in more ways than one.
17. i can't go home again. in more ways than one.


plots
- your father died saving me, an alien shapeshifter, and i promised to take care of his daughter, and assumed the shape of the other guy who died
- someone "uses their powers" for the first time in a certain area (director hank) and that attracts another one of his kind, but a bad version (white martian), etc.
- you see in [pictres] when the creature isn't near you that after x happens (they were rescued) they [exhibited signs of being a monaster] [like glowing eyes]
- they think all the (guards) died when the (prisoners) took over fort whatever and escaped, but it's actually one the guards who survied! and is now trying ot kill prisoners!

## sentimental
- she's the kind of person worth risking it all for. if i were you, i'd risk it.
- i lost everthing, and it makes a hole in our heart, but you can't fall into it, you have to fight, and fill it
- and he is compromising the safety of my _family_. guess which one i care about more (compared to the safety of this organization)
- 

# descriptive effects
- when a human body is describing in odd ways (scooping out their flesh like clay / the consistency of clay)
- brittle (flesh, wax, etc)


dream
- left messages for myself from the future, but obviously the dream was making them up, so i was creating what the answer to the mystery would be in clues without knowing the answer
